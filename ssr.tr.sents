i do
it 's halloween
uh i think it 's because i get to be something that i 'm not
and so do other people
i really like um to see other people on halloween
uh yeah
i try to do something every year
this past year uh i went as a catholic priest
and my girlfriend went as a catholic schoolgirl
so that was a little bit irreverent
we were both raised catholic
so it we thought that was pretty funny
um how about you
oh
all right
mhm
yeah
i think christmas would be my my second favorite holiday
especially
yeah
as far as are you a religious person
do you do you like it for religious reasons as well
mhm
oh yeah
mhm
oh
that 's pretty funny
we- wel- my girlfriend and i went to a wedding this weekend at the beach
and um we were talking about how at the beach for some reason they they seem to really to play up the santa claus aspect of christmas
and there 's just
i i guess
we were trying to figure it out
we were talking about it
and we 're we decided that it it 's because the th- i mean there are just so many souvenir shops at the beach
and there 's so many cheesy things at the beach
and we figured that santa claus was the ultimate cliche for christmas in a consumer culture etcetera etcetera
and and um
yeah
so we just decided that that 's why there were so many santa decorations at the beach
hm
um so well another thing i like about christmas is the um the the family aspect of it and just not doing anything for a whole day but getting to hang out with my family
and everybody 's off
that 's nice
yes
yeah
all of my family lives in mobile alabama actually
which is where i grew up
yeah
so i go down there
um so i 'm thinking for the second part which i i guess you did n't hear i 'm thinking the if i had to make up a holiday it would combine halloween and christmas kind of like a nightmare before christmas
have you seen that movie
yeah um something like that would be pretty cool
if you could dress up and be something that your not
and also everybody has the day off
so everybody can just hang out um and give gifts and dress up
that 'd be that 'd be pretty neat
mhm
yeah
and nobody gets a and nobody makes a big turkey or ham or anything for halloween
um
okay
so holidays
well do you have a favorite right off the top of your head
okay
so tell me about halloween
why it 's your favorite
mhm
well do you do you have like a specific person that you like to dress up as
or do you go with a di- kind of a different genre every year
or
eh eh yeah
well halloween 's not my favorite
i probably like th- christmas the most
but uh eh halloween i do enjoy it
last year i dressed up as um angelina jolie from now i ca n't remember the name of the movie tomb raider
i was the tomb raider girl last year
but uh i did n't get to eh go to any halloween parties this year
um i like halloween for the candy a lot and dressing up
but christmas bu- i guess just because we 're in it right now
it probably seems like my favorite because i like to uh go shopping
and it 's i- it 's a good reason to be able to go shopping because i 'm buying for somebody else
so nobody thinks that i 'm being wasteful
yeah
i like the decorations too
especially what
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
i like it for religious reasons
i mean christ 's birth and everything
it 's a
it 's a really joyous holiday
and it 's fun beca- well the only thing i do n't like about it is uh it seems like the whole santa thing has sort of taken over
and like i went to go find ornaments the other day
i wanted to buy some ornaments
eh i was on at a conference
and uh they only had they had like maybe two angel ornaments and no like really anything religious
it was all like santa and elves and everything
and i kind of felt like there should of at least be equal time or equal space for the different kinds
you know
really
like kind of the tropical santa sort of
yeah
yeah
i have n't been anywhere warm for christmas
i went over thanksgiving we my family and i fir- strangely enough went to florida
this is we usually have a traditional thanksgiving everything dinner
but went to florida
and it was a little weird to celebrate uh thanksgiving which i 've always associated with snow and cold and no leaves with sunshine and warmth
so
that was a little bit strange this year
but
mhm
that 's a good
yeah
that 's a good point
you get to see everybody
you get to hang out with them
most of the family gets together you know because nobody um has time to do it other times of the year
so it 's a good time to see everybody
do you have relatives that are out of town that you get to see
or
oh my gosh
thats quite a ways
that 's cool
mhm
yeah
mhm
yeah
especially because a lot of the holidays like halloween you do n't you do n't get the day off
so it does n't seem as much of a holiday
so that would be important is designing your own mixture would be that the- that you definitely get the day off
it 's like a state holiday or a federal holiday or something
and then
uh not particularly
i i uh am a volunteer on an ambulance squad
so it 's affected the squad quite a bit
but
n- no
just the way we run things
uh you know we like lock ambulances up and uh little more careful around the buildings and things like that
just small things
and then we always get these notices that we 're not supposed to tell anybody what they say
but i 'm sure everybody tells everybody what they say
eh
about security risks and things like that
uh actually i had some before september eleventh
i had like a weekend training session
and on uh
but it was at the time it was centered on uh what was then currently terrorist activity which is bombing of uh uh
yeah
pregnancy centers and abortion clinics and things like that
possibly
i do n't know
i mean i had one years ago
so
you
we- i d- i guess in the same way it 's affected my traveling only because it 's become more painful to travel
in in flying
the airports are you know take a lot longer to get through
yeah
in fact we went on a plane just after that
you know christmas time
yeah
okay
yeah
mm
not that i know of
i mean there 's only two of us living here
my kids are away
and as far as i know none of them changed anything
course n- i live closer to new york than they do
so
yeah
well you know there 's people in the community that were in the trade center and things like that
no
but w- what do they say
maybe two or three people removed
mhm
well let 's see si- for lack of anything else there was uh the day it happened we had visitors at our plant
and they got stuck here for almost a week
they were from california
and they could n't get home
so
well no
they were at a hotel
the th- they w- this was at work
so
yeah
well i guess our company was the opposite
our stock doubled or tripled as soon as the market opened
eh well because i work for a military subcontractor who also was making airport security equipment
so have you made any changes
not particularly
has it affected your activities on the squad
and how so
notices
are eh l-
uh-huh
uh-huh
and but have you done like any special training or anything like that
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and would you be one of these people to be uh uh n- receive the smallpox vaccine
mhm
that 's interesting
um how has it changed has it changed anything that we 've done
no
not really
i ca n't say that we 've made any
i mean i guess my husband travels a lot
and whenever they come out with a warning n- you know they were c- coming out with a warning about trains and i do n't know like like a month ago or something like that
and he frequently takes the trains
and m- b- w- ah oh after the warning came out we just sort of said you know why do n't you just like drive tomorrow instead of taking the train
so he did
but
i 'm sorry
eh in in what way
and so you have been on a plane since then
okay
and in th- in that sense it 's changed a little bit for me because it was really cheap
for the immediate time period after the terrorist attacks all the prices went down
and so i got on a to a to a plane probably when i would n't have because it was just so incredibly cheap
and i guess that 's not the case anymore
how about any members of your family have they changed anything
mhm
mhm
so you feel like you might be a little bit more cognizant of what 's going on
uh-huh
mhm
anybody that you know personally uh uh uh in
okay
yeah
i hear you
i know what you 're saying
yeah
i guess the whole thing was
whenever i read in popular media about how it 's making everybody think and do things differently and celebrate holidays differently and do this differently i did n't really i never really felt that
you know
um so anything else that you want to say on this topic
i bet that that would be
and they just could n't get home
they were lucky that they were stuck at at at friend 's house as opposed to a terrible hotel or something like that
ok-
oh
okay
okay
yeah
my parents were supposed to fly out to europe i think the following september twelfth
and they did n't
of course
so a lot of a lot of things that involved travel obviously changed immediately in our work place
and um pretty much everybody travels for some reason or another
and all of that got
and then the the economic changes
i guess that 's true
things have changed sort of economically
i mean my husband 's company has really gone through some uh a lot of times because of the you know stock market crash
and they wi- had a an immediate moratorium on travel and things like that
so that 's that 's pretty much changed things
wow
wow how come
aha
eh um i do n't know
i think it it probably does have like a pretty good effect
um but there are you know it 's like other weird stuff you know where like people will get like searched all the time
because of like you know like like i have a friend who 's israeli
and like every time she goes through the airport she gets eh every one of her bags searched like inside and out
but
yeah
yeah
exactly like i i had like another friend who like would go to like protests an- all the time and stuff like that like i- like for like th- uh world bank and stuff like that
and like he every time he flies gets pulled out like randomly
you know
but you know i guess like like when i my israeli friend does n't con- she does n't seem to mind very much
she just thinks it 's you know worth like the sacrifice for like better safety
but
yeah
yeah
yeah
because they 're saying now i read some article that like like they think like the hijackers on september eleventh used like pepper spray and stuff like that
so i do n't know how well they 'll be able to stop stuff like that
you know because i mean like they ca- you know i do n't know
i do n't know how
that ca n't be that hard to sneak onto an airplane
you know
but i guess you know you got to do what you can do i guess
i do n't know
no
this is the f- this is the first one like i 've been called for
yeah
i i do n't know if they just cut us off eventually
or
or what
but um
the airport security 's kind of a i do n't know quick quick um thing
you know
yeah
i do n't know
what do you th-
yeah
what do you think about like e- the pilots having like guns in the cockpit
yeah
yeah
and that 's that 's always the you know what they say about like guns at home too you know is that like i mean like guns like do n't really care like who 's shooting them
you know so like if like there 's a gun for the pilot
you know
yeah
exactly
like if they can like spray the pilot or something and you get the gun from him then they
yeah
they would have never been able to get a gun on before
but now they have a gun
so i do n't know
what
yeah
me neither
um
yeah
it probably at least like will prevent like like the r- like just like the random like attack type people
you know
like if like if probably like if al qaeda or something
like someone like planned something they 'd probably be able to get around it
but like if you 're just like random like militant you know like without like good organization it probably wo n't like prevent that kind of stuff
i do n't know
maybe
yeah
there 's probably a lot of people though that have gotten caught that were just like random like angry people you know that like did n't really know what they were doing that well
so it 's i guess it 's good in that regard
you know i do n't know
i 'm still not i 'm not totally convinced it 's never going to happen again though
yeah
yeah
um uh all right
no
no
i 'm in linguistics
yeah
i go to a- ohio state
where do you go
you go to school
what
oh yeah
yeah
um
yeah
yeah
i mean well it 's you know we 're about to do like the the uh fiesta bowl there
um did you see on the news about all the riots and stuff we were having down here
they had like like nineteen ca- twenty cars flipped and all these cars set on fire and stuff
like a ton of them were on like this street i lived on like just last year
i just moved off like like four or five months ago
it 's like real w- real weird
i was like you know i was almost like right in the middle of it
eh we beat michigan
so it 's like our big rival
and they they beat us most of the time
but like you know we 've had a new coach for two years
and like both years like they beat michigan
plus like
what do you think
yeah
i have like one of my friends he 's indian
and uh
yeah
he said every like now every time he goes to the airport they search everything he has
like he always is the w- you know the random person who gets pulled out of line
yeah
yeah
yeah
and i think it 's good
i mean de- only only thing it costs people is a little bit more time you know to get into the place
i th- i think it 's worth it
i mean i do n't think in e- i mean i think it i think it does lessen like the threat
but i mean it 's still there obviously
but i think it does help a little
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
you n- do you know how long we 're supposed to talk about this
oh
yeah
me too
yeah
yeah
i mean i i i 'll have to go on as much about it
like enough to have an inde- in-depth conversa- conversation about it
i i do n't know
like i think that 's kind of dangerous in a way because i mean if they eh because if you you you can stop them from bringing guns on
but then if there 's a gun on the plane they could somehow obtain it
like i think that 's kind of dangerous
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
i really do n't fly that much
so
i really do n't fly too often
so
i do n't i i really i really do n't think about this stuff
like i think if people want to try and do something they 're still going to try to
but maybe it ma- but maybe it puts in the back of their head to you know like we 're cracking down on it
you know
so maybe may- maybe that 's just a little bit to the i- it helps that way maybe
yeah
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
i mean if the- if they 're sophisticated enough they 're still going to find a way i believe
but
yeah
oh yeah
i know i mean it ma- it makes people feel safe for one thing
i mean it makes i mean it keeps people flying and stuff i guess
like you can never totally remove the threat
but i mean i- it may help a little
are you in engineering
or
oh
linguistics
at
georgia tech
georgia tech
ohi- ohio state 's pretty big is n't it
oh yeah
yeah
i saw that
like maryland
yeah
w- wha- why did that happen though
eh who 'd y'all beat
oh
michigan
oh yeah
yeah
i guess i 'm glad that they uh are checking for more things although i was pretty sorry to lose my pocket knife
but i just as i was walking around the airport i was thinking there are so many ways that somebody could get something on board an airplane
i mean the the food service people and i do n't know what they check with food service
or
huh
hm
yeah
huh
yeah
i guess so
i guess they do n't expect the elderly people to wrestle you to the ground or something
huh
well at least i feel as if there 's probably a little more professionalism then then in the past
yeah
right
yeah
well it seems as if you know if they 're doing more training they must be paying more
so have you ever been frisked or or told to undo your luggage or anything
oh really
huh
hm
yeah
uh-huh
huh
this must be overseas
i think i 've only been frisked once
they they run a sort of a a reader of some sort over you
yeah
right
huh
yeah
right
yeah
well i 've wondered looking around at at the passengers which of us they 're trained to i- i mean they must watch videos of passengers
and somebody says now see that person
he 's got something to hide
or see that one
that 's a nervous person
you should check that one
or
yeah
yeah
yeah
no
i never have
i 've um have n't had to ta- open it up and turn it on and find files or anything
yeah
oh
yeah
yeah
i have
uh-huh
i kno-
yeah
yeah
i know well actually um one airport i frequently fly through um kind of interesting it it 's a small airport
um and they i mean when we went through security it was a lot of it was actually elderly people um manning the security
and one of the women asked me to put my water bottle on the x. ray
and i 'm thinking hm what are you going to see
that you you know and then she 's like oh oh wait a minute
wait a minute
and and she just seemed flustered
and i was thinking hm i mean if they had to stop someone what would happen
but there were police sitting up um on a i do n't know pedestal area
you know so i guess they could 've intervened at any time
but it makes me wonder
you know how
mm mm
i do n't think so
so
yeah
i i do too
in fact before even before eh you know the the events have happened um i used to think gosh no one 's ever paying attention
you know and you know maybe they could n't necessarily be bland
i mean i do n't think the job was very
um perhaps the benefits were n't good
or you know there was n't a lot of motivation to excel
and now i think uh you know there 's probably more pressure on
and i do n't know if w- wages have gone up or anything
but uh i guess
right
right
yeah
yeah
an-
yeah
yeah
well actually well actually it 's interesting
um before nine eleven when i traveled actually it was the week before um when i came back to the u. s. from china um it was interesting because in china already the airports were very strict
um you know people could n't come in to the the terminal with you
um you know they say g- said goodbye before you went through security
and it was like bye
um and on my way out to china though i well my luggage was completely searched because i had this this transformer thing
but it was like this a heavy duty one because um we use a lot of audio visual equipment in our research
and i think you know it probably just looked like this thick black box on the x. ray
i do n't know
so you know so they actually had to like use this bomb thing
and but um that was the worst
but i guess i have n't had one of those random checks
um and one time they made us take off our shoes like on you know the domestic
um and they always seem to kind of frisk you like when you walk through
um well this
see i 'm
r- right
yeah
that 's what
yeah
i guess that 's what i 'm thinking of
not actual contact
yeah
yeah
so you know but um it 's pretty interesting
i do n't know
i mean i 've seen them ask people with hair loss to take off their hats and stuff
and it 's li- you know i find that interesting because i do n't know i mean w- would you ask someone to take off their pants
you know like it just seems to me that you know maybe some of the issues they 've they need a little more sensitivity
but you know i do n't know how much more you could hide under a hat then you could hide in your pants for example
so
yeah
yeah
i always get nervous just walking by
i 'm like what if they 're looking at me
what if they think i have something
yeah
so i think that too
and then i look at people
and i wonder if eh you know that person is someone they would be suspicious of or whatnot
yeah
it it is kind of neat
have you had to um have you had to like do you travel with a laptop or anything
yeah
i 've ha-
it 's kind of it 's funny because i i went through
and this was actually i think bef- because the federalized it now have n't they
i do n't know
this was this was kind of a while ago
but they um i had a c. d. drive a rewritable drive a portable one
i do n't know
i tend to be branded as royally conservative
and there 's a lot of things that i think are in bad taste
um eh
yeah
let 's see although i do use humor that 's related to race an awful lot
and i really should n't
but i have a feeling that becomes that comes from my background
um but uh making fun of i do n't know
i- if if i would n't say something to the person 's face then i might not say it
you know
mhm
yeah
but even as i was saying that i was thinking that i uh very often laugh at comedians that are you know mocking the hell out of uh um politicians and things like that
and uh you know if i were to say some of the things that have been said about george bush to his face he 'd probably be quite hurt
but i 'd laugh at them
so i do n't know
mhm
yeah
mhm
yeah
what do you think about things that are risque
or ah
mhm
mhm
mhm
that 's what i was just going to ask you
if they did that in a meeting full of all men do you think that the comments would have been in such poor taste
mhm
mhm
yeah
well when you were saying that i was trying to think th- because i agree with you that like you know um you know the common phrase is there 's a lady present
and then men tend to act differently
but you know it 's it is acceptable within men
and i was trying to think if there are things that women do that would not be acceptable around men
i mean i guess like in a sort of trivial thing eh w- women tend to mock men out a lot
and it 's made a joke if like a man is present and women start doing that
but that 's not really in poor taste
it 's just kind of like something that a man ca n't contribute to
or i do n't know
it 's interesting that the patterns it seems like the patterns of interaction with women that um like do n't take place with men like talking about clothes talking about weight talking about things like that they 're not in poor taste with men
but some of the patterns of interaction that men do um when women are n't around are considered in poor taste
yeah
no
not in the same way
mhm
yeah
yeah
it 's like the things that we look at
like you know an attractive man would have nice eyes and nice smile
yet an attractive women would have nice well not eyes and not smile
mhm
mhm
mhm
right
yeah
well what do you think
i mean
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i think that 's true
i think that often uh i mean one of one of the things that i think is in poor taste is if it 's something that would hurt the other person or would m- make fun of them in some way
uh politicians
yeah
yeah
well i guess yeah
that 's true
i guess it part of it is if you 're standing right there looking at the person you know or saying it yourself you know as opposed to someone else do uh making the the humorous remark
but uh i do n't know
i mean i guess also they 're talking about not just making fun but probably also um uh things that are you know risque or you know uh in some other way considered you know not not to be said in polite company
i do n't know
you know i had i had a a boss once who was just clueless
i do n't think he was trying to you know bug me because i was a woman
but he would he would often in in group meetings he would make uh humorous remarks that were uh uh of a sexual nature or of a i do n't know just something like that
that i felt was
yeah
i never said anything because i figured you know i do n't want to be a be a you know pain
but i i d- i doubt those kinds of things were in bad taste i mean because because i mean maybe maybe you know peop- same sex people can can do that kind of thing
where you know but when there 's someone of the opposite sex there then i do n't think that 's such a good idea
well i do n't know
not being a man i do n't know
i mean i think that me- my impression is or my my uh understanding is that men tend to use language and and and perhaps humor too that is more uh i do n't know uses four letter words and and and is is somehow you know more more sexual or more um uh the kind of thing that i would consider bad taste
and i do n't think that women tend to do that as much
do you
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
that 's right
that 's right
right
yeah
yeah
well that 's it
i mean talking about you know a woman and you know her attributes or whatever you know i mean that 's that 's something that i think men do as far as i understand
and and uh i do n't think that most women would do that
you know i mean we you might say oh he 's handsome
he 's really good looking
he 's really you know but uh really i i i do n't know
i mean maybe maybe even if you know you might say oh he 's hot
but but not to really get into the details of the anatomy or something like that
and i think men tend to do that more
i do n't know
so
yeah
right
right
exactly
and i do n't know whether that 's even humor
maybe we 're getting into another whole other topic here
but i think it can be you know it can be said in i- humorously
um i mean it can be done in in some you know in in a making fun kind of way or in uh in a laughing you know something that people would laugh about
um i was trying to think
i heard something the other day
i think it was probably something that was said on television that i thought was really in poor taste
and i ca n't remember what it was now
but it was i mean i think it was on a on a on a sitcom or something
but i just thought it 's not the kind of thing that i want to really hear
i ca n't remember what it was
but it was something you know something to do with someone 's anatomy or something like that as i recall
i 'd say i guess it 's a question that we can make as hard or as easy as we want
like say your brother kills somebody in a manner that 's completely not his fault
but will appear as if it were his fault in the court of law
uh
yeah
i 'm i 'm trying i 'm i guess it 'd be easier to deal with like with as an example
that 's the first thing i thought about
what 's what 's a tough decision
like because i guess on the one hand you know well by telling the truth what would you be doing
you 'd just be making things really complicated because he 's not really guilty of it
but like if you do n't you know like like the dead person 's family wants to know what happened or who 's responsible
or
yeah
yeah
or like
well i mean
oh yeah
or what if your brother they ask what if your brother like your brother did commit murder
wow
well i do n't know
it ma- makes it makes me think though just because yeah
well i mean i guess ah that 's that 's unbiased honesty
but then again i i ju- i 'm really wary of talking about how morally upright i 'd be able to be in a tough situation
like you know i 'd like to think i 'd do the right thing all the time
you know i would n't be scared
or but you know like p- thinking about it sitting around on the couch is one thing
but like i mean like you know because well once you get into like what if you start thinking like
all right
what 's done is done
you know like it was an uncharacteristic thing
like you know i know my brother 's a really good person
i know he 'll like he 's smart
he 's creative
he 'll really benefit society
like you know he lost his head
or this other person provoked him
or like you know i- it was wrong
but like how is my brother going to jail and me betraying my own brother and living with that and like how is that going to make it better
yeah
your f- the whole family
yeah
yeah
i guess you have to examine like
i guess you 'd have this this is that 's a this is like a time when you really examined you know how willing a member you are of the society in a- almost a lockian sense
like you know you accepted this social contract
now are you going to sack it up and accept everything that goes with it
mhm
hm
and what kind of situation do you think would like
i mean that 's kind of i mean i- i- i understand the
right
i mean it 'd be kind of um unless you were there it would be kind of hard to to understand that you know i mean you 're just sort of taking that your your friend or your brother 's or you know you 're just sort of taking their word that that they are n't responsible
and that 's sort of i i guess it comes to an issue of you know do you i- if if someone was you know being put on trial for something ee- that that i guess you knew a little bit about but not a whole l- lot about
you know you just sort of have to
you know how much do you trust this person to be telling you the truth or you know something like that
at least that 's what
well i mean i would i mean if i knew about out it i mean i i really would n't have any other choice
but but to you know i mean that
i you know i would n't i would never protect him i mean if if he did something like that
i mean that 's just it 's about the worst thing you can do
so
i do n't think i definitely do n't think that would be something that i would ever do
e it 's just i mean that 's a the horrible situation that
i mean i i 've i 've had a family member that 's actually done that
like i ha- i had a cousin who killed his own sister
so
i mean it 's definitely a you know i mean i- it it 's an awful situation
and it should
you know i mean if that had ever happened you know and if i was there or if i knew anything about it then i mean i would n't have lied for him
no way in the world
right
but then when you get into it
right
well that 's i mean there are a lot of
that i mean that 's such a tough situation
i mean th- e- e- especially if it 's i mean if it 's something major that you know would be life impacting to you know i mean not just your brother but your parents you know an- any other siblings you know anything like that it would be really hard to to i mean you know because you just basically have to i mean you have to make a decision
and you have to stick with it
and then you 're going to have to deal with it pretty much for the rest of your life if your brother 's in jail or you know if they 're you know if they 're free and they 're walking around and you know that somebody else 's family is devastated because they
i mean if you know that he did it or if you do n't i mean it 's just sort of
right
or like i mean also if you were
uh i mean i guess it 's the same thing that that you know some members of like juries have to do and stuff
i mean they you know i mean like if you were in the called to jury duty for a friend that you knew and would you would you say that you knew them
or you know just sort of say oh no
i do n't know this person
i do- you know i do n't know this case
and just sort of get on there
and you know that you could help them out
or you know that they would n't do that
or you know
the reality of it is i- that uh it is n't i did n't open it with a vast amount of money
we 've been a sort of a shoestring operation ever since we started it
um but uh i do n't know
i 've i 've often thought it would be fun t- uh to uh open a restaurant
oh yeah
yeah
uh because you 'd only be open at night
uh-huh
right
right
what kind of a restaurant would you like to open
uh-huh
um it 's a very hard business i gather
is that right
yeah
i think tha- the the difficulty often is that if you uh if you go into it uh and you 're doing the cooking or you 're you know uh part of it every day you ca n't leave and go on to another business
so i- it means that you 've got to be there early
you 've got to make all the preparations
you 've got to do all that cooking
you 've got to it burns you out fairly quickly
and i think a lot of people now if we had all this money
right
including a a uh uh uh what do they call it a sous chef uh s- somebody to help you with your cooking or me with my cooking
that 's what i would like to do would be to to design the menu to to work with the chef in in preparing uh the dishes and knowing just what the recipes are and designing the uh you know the the restaurant and what it looks like
i think i 'd have more fun being the maitre d' socializing with people and recommending this dish or whatever
you know
hm mm mm no
no
i have n't
although eh eh m just uh uh by r- i suppose uh w- what gets me thinking about it is that uh i do all the cooking in the family
so uh it 's i love to cook
i always have
so
like you i i see myself as being the cook
but i can also see myself burning out very quickly if that 's all i was doing day in and day out year round
yeah
uh-huh
neat
mhm
mhm
but you think you 'd rather run a restaurant than than do catering
uh-huh
that does sound like fun
yeah
yeah
that 's
eh right
uh-huh
apparently
yeah
yeah
would you have yours right downtown
or would you have it in the suburbs
or the
or a resort someplace
or
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
yeah
actually that 's what i 'd like to do
yeah
well i was going to say if i had all the money though i might open a nightclub just because it would be less work for me
um no
just because like well if i owned a restaurant i would want to be the chef
um and so eh you know it 's just really hard work backbreaking work
you know what i mean
like cooking
um well actually i 'm a vegetarian
so i 'd always thought it would be good to open um a vegetarian restaurant that had like really really really good uh dinner entrees and things
like like all different kinds of food
but
yeah
i guess that 's part of the challenge too
like whether to be open for breakfast lunch and dinner and you know because i do n't know it 's a hard um a hard industry a hard business to get into and make it successful
i think there 's like a sixty or seventy percent fail rate or something like that
or that 's what it was at one point
i i had done some research into it like i do n't know maybe ten years ago or something
yeah
that 's right
yeah
yeah
then we could hire a good staff
yeah
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
have you um done any restaurant like that type of work before or worked with anyone that had
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
well
yeah
yeah
i think you 'd have to delegate some of the work and maybe just be the manager that eh or s- you know something like that at some point
so it 's pretty fun
i mean i have a friend who does catering sometimes
well she was a chef for maybe three or four years at a hunting lodge
and she 's really a good chef
i mean she just comes up with the best things
and so i get to work with her
um and like i learn a lot of um really good things to cook eh desserts and stuff
and uh we catered this dinner together
it was like a sit down dinner for fifteen people something like that
and i- it 's it really is like fun
i do n't know
i just like to serve people good food
you know
so um
yeah
yeah
i 'd want it to be like a cool place where people would want to come and hang out too because i think it would be cool to have like the restaurant part but then like a cafe part on the outside for like sandwiches and like breakfast and stuff like that
so but but i mean then again i guess if we had all the money that you can do whatever you want
so when i think about it i 'm like okay
maybe i should start out with the cafe
and then move on to whatever else if i was successful at it
you know
so um i guess picking where you want to have your restaurant is a big part of being successful
um i mean i do n't
no
i guess i just do n't know where
i think it would probably be in a city in a big city
um
wow
that 's great
yeah
uh yeah
a- seattle 's really um come in its own over the last ten or fifteen years in that regard the the arts and everything else
i- it 's great
um let 's see what would i do
hm
well you do
i guess you 're doing better than iowa
yeah
yeah
i like to go a i i think i 'd j- open up a bookstore like powell 's
oh
oh definitely
definitely
yeah
i 'd like to um
yeah
maybe a bookstore
maybe something small at first
i- if money 's no object like they said then which is pretty uh fantastical
but i- i would just be uh uh uh you know n- uh i just worry about making the payroll to the other people or or getting the cash flow to keep the uh to keep the business going
hm no
it it probably would be general
um n- n- uh definitely some best sellers to get the traffic in
but uh a lot of history
um a lot of um you know just a lot of i- oh maybe some e- you know a big eclectic corner or something
but um j- you know just something to generate you know some people coming in and and maybe like uh you know have have like a little coffee area in there or whatever
oh
de- oh
definitely
yeah
i think um i think those are becoming you know like telephones now you know and bathrooms
you know you h- you have to have one
you have to have a uh especially it 's two thousand two
i i just ca n't believe that
tw- ten years ago nobody knew about the internet
just am- just amazing and uh what 's out there
so
yeah
i would definitely have to have some sort of access
it would have to be off someplace else because um uh d- did you ever go into a room like in a library where they have computers all you can hear is like the clacking of the keyb- the keys
yeah
so it would have to be off to the area
maybe a little little little panels or something
yeah
so tell me about your business
yeah
i have n't heard that word in in ages
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
right
yeah
hm yeah
i think that 's the way of most theater
i do n't know why
but um like during the summer um there 's a lot of theaters little th- theaters up and down the coast here uh in massachusetts
that uh like you know there 's some situat- n- up and down the coast there 's all these little tiny playhouses
but then in the winter all you have is the nutcracker
everywhere does the nutcracker
boston uh boston ballet does the nutcracker
and it 's like ye- i i think i swear to god that they get like half their money for the year to do all the other stuff from just doing the nutcracker
yeah
and i bet you it 's on the radio
and it 's on the it 's in the newspaper
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
a- do you see the uh the future of um performance art uh i mean in the in the t. v. internet age do you see that declining
or
yeah
okay
yeah
right
mm
yeah
i 'm an artist
and i 'm a painter and a dancer
i think that i would probably buy there 's this little burlesque theater over on aurora
this nice street that 's just an old theater that 's kind of closed down
open it up
turn it into a gallery
and have performance art there and stuff
yeah
i do n't know
uh i fund raise for the arts for a living
they 're not doing that well
we 're in a pretty big recession out here
probably
yes
probably better than iowa
so what would you d-
oh that would be wonderful
where would you open it in boston
mhm
what kind of books would you sell
any specialty
or just like
would you have computers in there
get the internet access
yeah
that 's true
huh
ah yeah
a little seating room
that would be nice
oh the burlesque theater
i know
it 's just really like cute little um i think it 's completely abandoned
little old theater that has a bear on it that says something like everything is bare
you know like it 's kind of scandalous
but back in the day it was scandalous
nowadays it 's not
n- i do a japanese dance form called butoh
and um then i would have a place to house all kinds of performances because there 's so much wonderful theater going on in this town
and uh the the big theaters are n't necessarily picking it up
so
mhm
oh
it 's true
we 're doing the nutcracker out here at the seattle symphony i i 'm sorry the seattle pacific northwest ballet
yup
oh
yeah
posters for it everywhere
but you know it 's true though
people want to see classics
they want to hear a name that they 're familiar with
they definitely make a lot more money if it 's a po- more familiar name
i think that 's the problem with art
it 's not well advertised enough in general
no
i do n't think it 's declining
i just do n't think it 's marketed
i think it 's it 's very prevalent for sure
i mean it 's the same thing
it j- goes on and on and on
everyone does the same performance art over and over and over again
but i think it 's always present
the fine arts are in every aspect are just as present
they 're just not sold because people want to see things that they 're familiar with like michelangelo and you know all the popular people
so that 's what get sold
images in i- you know van gogh and picasso and matisse
i mean it 's the same with performance art
it 's always those that are dead
i do n't know what that 's about
enough advertising that their name got out
um i do n't think so
but i 'm not married
i 'm only twenty-three
so
um but i do n't i do n't think it has
i think it i mean it just seems like something to be more aware of
but
right
but i think i mean among my friends a lot of my friends have started getting married recently
and i think that that
i i do n't feel like it 's changed how how they 've approached marriage
i mean i think that they 're still you know willing to risk it i guess
um i think it 's about it 's about half
but um my my parents are not divorced
but i certainly have lots of friends whose parents are
um and trying to think although most of my married friends ' parents did n't get divorced
yeah
so maybe maybe they were more likely to get married you know earlier than than people whose parents are divorced
right
right
yeah
i think that i think that um
well i ca n't remember what i was just thinking
i think that
um well i think that having it be more sociably acceptable is probably better because then people are n't staying in in you know bad relationships
um actually most of the most of the people most of my aunts and uncles and everything have we 've never really had divorce in in my family
and one of my uncles is going through it right now
and i know my my grandparents really are upset about it because they have never you know had to deal with it
and they did n't really think it was a good thing
but i think that i mean people can change
and not necessarily for the better
so it 's good to have the option
right
right
yeah
i think it can be it can be hard on families especially if there are kids involved
uh-huh
mhm
yeah
right
especially so young
i 'm sure she did n't i mean she was n't aware of a lot of problems then
and
that 's good
right
right
i remember when i was um in elementary school my best friend 's parents were divorced
and her parents would kind of com- compete for you know her love and affection by um seeing who could give her the best presents
and i kind of thought that was a good deal
like look her dad took her to the cyndi lauper concert
that 's so awesome
and i told my parents i wished they would get divorced
i do n't think they appreciated that though
but um
yeah
i do n't i do n't think it 's really i mean hugely impacted how i think about marriage
i think i want to get married
i do eventually
yeah
right
right
i think and i actually one of my friends has gotten married and has gotten divorced already
but i think they rushed into it
so we we were n't that surprised that they got divorced actually
yeah
yeah
yeah
well i
yeah
i think in a way it 's good
i 'm i 'm div- i was divorced
i 'm i got married too early
and then i was divorced
and now i 'm married again
and it 's good
it 's much better than if i had stayed with that first person
so i i think the only thing is it makes pe- some people maybe not think take marriage as seriously as they would have otherwise
but you know
mhm
yeah
yeah
do are most of your friends ' parents not divorced
or
yeah
yeah
oh
a l- little trend there
yeah
yeah
hm
hm
w- yeah
my in my parents ' generation hardly anybody got divorced
so i mean if you did it was this there was a huge stigma
i remem- i remember when i was growing up there was one divorced woman up the street who had a daughter my age
and it was like you know going into their house it was like going into some sort of bizarre
i mean
the way the rest of the neighborhood acted you 'd as- you know you would think that there 'd be something really different about their house that there 's something really weird about this person because it was so unusual
but
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
it is
yeah
the the one thing that i regret when i think back on my first marriage is that i did n't realize how much it affected other people besides just us
you know i just thought okay we 're not getting along
it 's terrible
or you know we 'll get divorced
and i did n't realize that that our bo- that his parents and my parents would just be completely devastated because it was such a different thing for them
you know
yeah
yeah
my my husband was divorced also
and he has a daughter who 's in college now
but you know she she seems all right
you know if anybody ever asks her about it she says well i do n't know
you know it 's better than if they did n't get along and stayed together
she she was five when they got divorced
or four i guess
and so she was just kind of used to it
you know and about half her friends had divorced parents
so you know it she did n't think anything of it really
had two different houses
yeah
yeah
and i mean in a way it was n't a problem
she had two different places to go
and her parents you know were civil to each other
and they did n't get her in the middle
it 's probably more of a pain now you know during holidays when she 's got to come and visit both of us
spend her whole holiday visiting parents
but otherwise i do n't know
mhm
yeah
oh
oh
that sounds good
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
i mean it does n't se-
you do want to get married
one day
yeah
yeah
it does n't seem like anybody would say well let 's see i i think i want to get divorced when i when i get older
you know everybody everybody must hope their marriage is going to last
yeah
yeah
uh
who 's we
the united states
or the world in general
yeah
well what could we do instead
i mean i because my opinion is that it 's sure disaster no matter what happens
it 's just you can put it off longer
or it 'll happen quicker
uh-huh
yeah
i 'd agree with that
yeah
i agree with that as well
yep
how we give the israelis all sorts of money weapons everything
support political clout
right
yeah
yeah
right
we agree on that
are they are they going to tell us when the ten minutes is up
yeah
okay
right
uh do you know why israel was created originally
and at that point could they created a palestine nation
like were they organized enough to exist in their own right
yeah
all right
uh sounds good enough to me
uh-huh
they felt like giving something back to the jews
yeah
right
okay
right
well i do n't know about that 's going pretty far
right
yeah
yeah
i guess tha-
yeah
fair enou-
y- yeah
might as well
show the world
make a point
yeah
well what are the israelis supposed to do
you know
right
they 've got to have a country at this point
i would n't i would n't know that much
i do n't go that far back
um well i 'm just a young buck
um well uh
okay
the problem right now is yasser arafat would be such a terrible leader
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
well i
i do n't know
i-
it seems like most of the buildings over there are half blown away
so i
eh yeah
yeah
oh
it 's pretty lopsided
yeah
i think we 're headed down the road to sure disaster if we continue the way we have been
yes
um well i 'd say the united states
and the reactions we get with our current policies
um i guess i guess i feel our problems i mean right now the current emphasis is on iraq but i feel that actually our problems are deeper than that
that this is just kind of a this is kind of a grudge match here um leftover from father bush
and also that it 's fueled by oil
um i am real concerned about the in equitable qual- um treatment we give people in the mid east mainly the israelis and the palestinians
we
yeah
blanket you know blank check
do whatever you want with n- no regard whatsoever to the palestinians
and considering that you know these people are essentially without a country
and have been since israel was created
so well what do we do for the next ten minutes
i do n't know
like i said i 've never done this before
so um so got anymore thoughts on what i just said
um i 'm not real i 'm not really good on the whole details of it
but the way i understand some guy um in england great britain whatever in the twenties came up with this whole zionist state idea
so it was kind of lingering on
and i mean if you know more correct my thinking here
uh and um after of course the atrocities of world war two you know it was
right
right
after you know the world looked the other way and let what happened to them happen
so and then it i mean the whole thing was created as if this was you know a desert with no one living there
and in reality that 's not what it was
so i just thin- i mean i you know i i hm i mean and not like i think you know suicide bombing is a good thing
but i can certainly understand why there are people there taking those measures
you know i think if
well no what i 'm saying is i try and imagine if i was living in those conditions i would probably be driven to the same point of desperation and probably not real clear thinking
you know because i mean if i guess when you well i feel if you get to the point where you have nothing to lose you know it gives you permission to do things that that if you did have have something to lose you 'd never do
so
um i well see this is it
i mean you ca n't go back i do n't think to what it was before israel was created
so
right
so i think that that the world and mainly the u. s. since we seem to be the ones with the big power right now needs to make a real honest effort of being equitable and sitting down and working on peace
and i guess way back when jimmy carter was at it i thought we had a good start
i 'm an old woman
and i 've been paying attention
um i really do n't you see i guess i really do n't understand what what the complaint is about him any more than anyone else
i just think that the israelis with with the things they 're doing now they are driving people to support yasser arafat
you know it 's kind of like when you tell a kid not to do something
certain kids will just like well
okay
i 'm going to do it
you know
so
yeah
just my opinion of course
i do n't know
i mean and the thing is unless they uh they have a p- uh set up so that they actually have a government and they can have people free to choose ah i do n't know
how are you going to get anything better than yasser arafat
how are you even going to have how can he even function
you know i mean is n't he living in like a half blown away building now
as an exile
yeah
i mean whenever s-
yeah
whenever one suicide bomber goes out and kills a bunch of people then you know the israelis show up with their tanks and you know bulldoze a couple neighborhoods
and it 's i mean when when you read the f- the facts of how many casualties there have been there 's like three to one palestinians
yeah
palestinians to israelis
and i just really have problems with even the news coverage in our country
last i heard south korea was talking about doing nuclear testing that would affect alaska and hawaii because of the way the trade winds go
oh um trying to
trying to stop them
um well a- m- part of me says yeah we know a lot more than when the united states did nuclear testing
and so we should take additional precautions
um and part of me goes well you know they never asked permission while we were testing
um i think that 's it for south korea
let 's see
well and the united states does n't seem to be the only target for it either
oh
yeah
gee why are n't there any terrorists in iraq
yeah
tha-
well yes at least five
mhm
uh let 's see i do n't think the united states is in any danger of being bought out by japan
oh
i found out from a friend who lived in japan for a number of years that um the japanese thought land in the u. s. you know businesses and and apartment buildings and office building were such a bargain
well they were compared to the um the japanese uh real estate
oh yeah um the japanese infrastructure is terrible in the moving of goods
it 's actually cheaper to make something in japan and ship it to the u. s. and sell it there than it is to get it through the um e- u- there 's this chain of you know from the manufacturer to the wholesaler to th- e- ther- with lots of steps in between there
hm
hm
hm
got a four this last time
yeah
i heard that this morning too on the news
um so um yeah basically m- i guess that 's definitely a threat
um do you think it 's something we should be uh participating in as the u. s.
eh trying to stop them
mhm
right
i guess i i guess that 's it for south korea
yeah um i guess obviously iraq
um usually a big one
um i do n't know if it 's as dangerous to us as it is to other foreign countries
i do n't think that i mean i understand the terrorist threat
but i think that i do n't think that iraq is the one so far being the the key to that
i think that 's g- uh different groups that are doing that
um that 's true
that 's true
um but at the same time iraq does n't seem like they 're having any foreign uh wha- we might not just be hearing about it but they do n't seem to be having any terrorists in their country
so makes you kind of wonder
well that we 're hearing about
all though you know i guess we might have i do n't know w- we might have some of our s- uh our people over there um probably
there 's i 'm sure there 's some agents over there that they would call e- m- terrorists i guess probably over there
um yeah
spies or something
so um i do n't know
what other countries do you think
neither do i
uh-huh
mhm
oh yeah actually i 'm originally from minnesota
and um we in at the mall of america they have uh a lot of people uh who come over from japan and other countries um with s- such prices as japan does
and they actually will travel over to the mall of america get their um uh get m- m- buy things over in america n- travel back
and it 's still cheaper than buying whatever they were going to buy in japan
oh really
oh yeah
there 's mm mm too many yeah too many people in between the steps
wow tha- that makes sense i suppose
i suppose that 's where internet is really great for our companies because then they can go over and n- buy it from us
and we can ship it over to them
but but then again we 're buying all the japanese cars
so i guess it goes both ways
oh do you
i 've got a jeep
so um still trying to stay american
i do n't know how much of the parts are really there
but that 's interesting
okay well i guess i do n't know what else to say
um
oh
right
i 'd agree with you
i think that my experience has been really similar
uh i 'm a graduate from u. t. system as well
and i think that uh i i my major my concentration was in business
and my experience with computers
uh a lot of wha- w- our interaction was was primarily formulary
and it was for calculus and solving various equations
and while it 's definitely advantageous to understand the principles underlying the formula and the various methodologies used in business it did n't seem to me to make a whole lot of sense to have to memorize these formulas just like you
i i i think you probably carried around a scientific calculator
uh we certainly carried around business calculators that performed these functions for us
and it and it it definitely was n't a dumbing down tool
it was something that enhanced our ability to perform advanced computations in a shorter amount of time
but i think computers affect us in the same way
they allow us the opportunity to accomplish much more
in the same way that cars have outpaced people traveling and by foot
i think computers have sort of out paced allowed people to excel beyond their normal capacities for performing advanced computations or whatever the application might be
sure
oh
right
okay
yes
you 're you 're on the money with that completely
no
it 's
agreed
no
you 're absolutely correct
there i- there is an over reliance i- in many ways there is an over reliance on the convenience factor of technology
and i think that is a a very valid argument
it 's a difficult one because you could look at it not just from computers standpoint but from electronics
not even electronics in general but any tools that we used
unfortunately our whole foundation of society 's been driven more towards a convenience oriented society
and you 're right
there is an over reliance of people on machines to do the work and think for us
it 's a curious mix
and i agree with you completely
it 's frightening when you walk into a store
and you know you 've got a a cashier at a cash register who 's scanning items across on a bar code scanner and you know not exactly sure what the individual prices are
if the machine makes a mistake the customer is the one who pays
and also and when it comes time to get your change you 're absolutely right
uh it people ca n't necessarily always count to make change
they have to rely on what the machine tells them
so
yeah
that 's a really valid argument i think you made
and it 's a good it 's a good
yeah
it 's a it 's a really good point
hm
right
i understand
i 've uh i 'm a business graduate from uh university of houston
but when i started i was in engineering
and i know that one of the things that used to make me mad on tests was that you had to memorize formulas
and so i i thought that was kind of silly because if you were doing a job you 'd have the formulas
well i i feel much the same about computers
i 've heard some folks say you know that they 're not they kind of uh take the thinking away for you
but for me it 's a tool
so that 's kind of what i think about it i guess
uh so it 's good
uh yeah
i
for sure
well it sound like you and i are in agreement
maybe i 'll throw in a devil 's advocate thing
and and this happened in the metroplex
i used to be the personnel manager for uh winn dixie up there
yeah
i 'd train a lot of grocery checkers and all
and have you heard and maybe you feel the same way i know i do sometimes the kids ca n't give change uh if the machine is down
by that by that i mean they only can look at and say what
yeah
yeah
and so i wonder now i 'm doing devils advocate but i i wonder if the u- use of computers big time has some bad effect uh on the ability to reason
and i 'm kind of going out on a limb here
i 'm not sure where i meant with that that statement
but but it does kind of make you feel funny when somebody ca n't do change for a dollar but knows that it 's twenty-three cents
so
mhm
mhm
it does it does almost make sense does n't it
and i
i 've got another one to throw in
that may you know it 's
yeah
sure
now i 'm pumping up college graduate shit
and i 've been in college
it
what i find i 'm a little bit older guy
i 'm fifty eight
so for me the things that i used to know about algebra that 's all i can really think of at the moment as an example it really is a strain to get back and do
uh what used to be i know i r- remember were fairly simple uh tasks uh mathematical is what i 'm saying uh i- it 's like i sort of have forgotten uh how to do those things
just mainly because i either have n't used them which kind of must complicate the question or that i 've forgotten the formulas and those things uh that you used to know pretty cold
so do you think family values are important
well as a teacher i have seen declining family morals over the last twenty-five years
and it 's really pretty scary
i uh eh see the the dissolution of marriages causing children to have problems
and i see y- you know single parent families
and all of this has such a a negative effect on children that i 've also taken a job after school these days as a coordinator for a group of children who are at risk socially and academically
and what we 're trying to do with them is instill some moral values with them also
but unfortunately if these children are n't raised in you know f- family homes to begin with it 's kind of tough to do when you just have them during the day
and then you know that they are going to go out on the streets at night and you know do what they normally do
no
they really do n't
that 's true
very true
i see that in this program
definitely
you know the parents need help probably as much or more as the kids do
you know and i 've always been fortunate because as a teacher i 've always been home with my children
you know they were i went back to work when my daughter was um three and a half
but you know i was very fortunate because we live in a small town
and it was only five minutes from my work to pick her up
and we were always home by a quarter till four
which gave us the entire evening
m-
yeah
i did n't do anything extra at all when my kids were little
you know i did n't take on any extra responsibilities in the least
we were home my husband is a principal
so he was always home a little after four
so we had you know four to five hours every evening to spend with our kids when they were young
and we were both off during the summer as we still are
so we 're doing the same thing with our grandchildren now
we bring our grandchildren home with us quite frequently
and we took our grandson to uh florida for a little over a week this summer
and you know it 's just it 's it 's very important for kids to know that they have roots that go back a long way
you know so it it needs to be extended families
you know aunts and uncles and brothers and sisters all need to keep in touch
yes
um my son 's twenty-eight
and um he 's never been married
and i believe that uh we 're lutheran
and i believe he 's got some good morals
and he is engaged now
uh this y- i believe he 's going to wait uh next june
yes
i think they 're very important
yeah
they just n- they do n't know the difference
um
they 're not grounded
or um they have n't had anything else to compare with
and i think the programs in the evenings are excellent
um i was associated not very much because it does take time after you know your work day and your family uh with scan
it 's uh
it 's an association that takes care of uh i guess battered or neglected more than anything children
um in
it- it 's not just the children
it- it 's the parents who raised the children or had them
they did n't have a good ground or a good start
so when they develop or or have their families it 's um it 's really sad
it 's almost like they need attention
it 's just really they do n't know any better
they 've never been taught
so there 's generations there that um do n't have the benefit of what some of us had with good parents and grounding
yes
because a lot of people
yes
because a lot of people have to commute
and and then maybe their jobs make them have a longer day
you just do n't know
what
yeah
yeah
it 's real important
and and even the closet families with their schedules whether it 's their jobs or other friends or second jobs
or or just um it 's hard for uh cousin aunt to have those occasions and get-togethers
i know my aunt when our family you know as we age um one of our older aunts made um a big point to gather up like once a week
right
right
i agree
and i think we 're um less likely to believe in the future of such things and and in um future of uh current investments particularly in retirement funding
yeah
well per- personally i 'm i mean i 'm sixty-two
so i had my uh eh retirement um in an i. r. a. and uh pretty much socked away before it r- m- eh this s- sort of thing started
but it certainly has affected my um belief system
and um a- and i 'm because i 'm of retirement age i 'm much more um afraid of what 's going to happen
um and as soon as things pull up a little bit i want to get my investments in a much more uh conservative position
i was y- i was heavily funded in stocks because things you know looked pretty cheerful
so i 'm going to change my investment um picture as soo- i- a- if things do in fact stabilize
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
oh dear
uh-huh
oh sure
yeah
and see you 're my children 's age
and they have uh i mean i 'm constantly afraid i 'm going to get a phone call and one of them you know one of them
yeah
yeah
i 'm coming home
tha- right
right
right
right
but you know it 's it 's something that is so different from whe- when i was their age
and and things were so much more stable
oh dear
um well i 'm i 'm a liberal democrat
and i i really um i fear that um the way things have gone where e- economically um y- you know we 're so eh uh w- we have gone way back into debt
and i do n't approve of that
and i eh you know i i wish that we had n't
i i wish that mm we were not in a um a spending and an indebted economy
but i have a really good friend who keeps trying to convince me that being in debt is a healthy economy
and um i just do n't see that
i d- i wish that um we were not so heavily dependent on petroleum
and i would like to see us uh be less so
and i 'm very concerned u about the situation in the middle east right now
and that we 're going to
you know i w- i oh dear could i go on
yeah
what do you think the government can do
uh-huh
yeah
i have n't either
yeah
what because i do n't want to stray too far from that
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
um yeah
i 'd have to say i think the corporate scandals have had some effect too
i do n't know that that 's the whole uh i i enj- i mean in fact i i would say i do n't believe it 's the whole reason the economy is having the problems it 's having
but i d- i certainly think that it 's contributed um because people have a lot less faith in the stock market and uh the value of their stocks and that kind of thing
uh when when you know when you have things like enron and worldcom and and things like that where these stocks just go into the dump
uh yeah
yeah
i agree with that
i- uh so um how has it affected you personally would you say
uh-huh
right
yeah
well i mean on- one would think that they would have to
i i mean who knows
but one would think that eh eh for for me i think that um uh uh you know i 'm thirty-five
and um i do n't know that the eh the corporate scandals have affected me exactly
the bad economy certainly has
um you know there 's been layoffs at the company i work for
uh you know i 'm always i 'm alwa- i i work in the tech sector
i 'm a systems manager
um so eh you know i 'm a- i 'm really always kind of worried about getting a job and and and keeping a job and and all that kind of thing
so
hey mom
you know that room you converted into a sewing room
so what do you think uh to answer the other question what do you think the government can do
right
well i agree with yo- i me- i agree with you on some of those things
um however specifically like with with the corporate scandal stuff i do n't know why i 'm you know trying to uh b- i mean i h- like i said i have n't done one of these before
but for me with the specifically the corporate sand- scandal stuff what i think what i think needs to happen in those cases is i think that the um you know th- there 's not a whole lot the government can do
you know but what the government can do is they can they can uh eh create a real sense of accounta- countability-
to where the ken lays and the and the guys that are you know that are right now seem to maybe some people seem to be profiting from some of this are are held accountable
and they 're punished t- to the full ex- fullest extent of the law
you know and i guess my concern about that is that you know for instance enron you know contributed heavily to the campaigns of
uh well my church probably affected everyone in america somehow
i mean you know
yeah
uh stock market really did n't affect me at all
i 'd m- i stopped investing years ago personally
but um i mean you know you look at like worldcom
and well that kind of affected us in a way
we we use m. c. i.
but um i mean there have n't been any changes except customer service
how about you
mhm
okay
right
well see that 's the thing that really boggles my mind
i remember back in mid nineties when the stock market was n't even up to seven thousand
an- i mean you know now we 're pushing ten thousand
and the analysts in you know washington are saying you know the stock market is doing poorly
compared to what
last week
or last month
or
i mean you know go back ten years and the stock market 's healthier than it 's ever been
and i mean you know when you have people like bill gates get ninety-nine point five million dollars for the stock dividend and everyone else gets you know sixteen cents per share it 's like okay
what what 's going on here
yeah
i mean you know that that 's where it seems a lot of the problem is where the c. e. o.s are getting multimillion dollar salaries
and you know the president 's making two hundred thousand dollars a year
and it 's like who has the harder job
who 's got the harder job
but i mean you know they they get the multimillion dollar salaries
they get all the stock options and everything else
and then they hire all the outside accounting firms to doctor the papers and you know do whatever they need to do
then the government comes along w- with the regulations saying oh well you need to make stock declarations and restate any earnings or losses by the state
then everyone starts saying oh we need to restate
we need to restate
and you 're still hearing that now
it 's like wait a second
and i mean is there a way the government can actually control anything
no
not any better than what the government can um even control itself
right
and
yeah
i mean i forget who it was
some senator or congressman years ago said we have so many regulations on the book
they 're there for decoration only because you ca n't enforce them
i mean unless of course we go out and a giant government where it 's basically you know ten people to every one citizen in the government and you know overlook every facet of li-
u- e- and truly have big brother
but i mean other than that i do n't know any way that um n- any law can help anything
everything comes down to the basic premise of who 's being honest
yeah
yeah
right
mhm
so how did bethlehem steel get affected by the uh the all the problems
or was it just the business itself
right
did um
right
has that affected you in anyway
especially on the stock market
mhm
mhm
oh
i see
okay
okay
i 'm trying to think
um not personally except for the stock market
um but that 's not entirely that either
that 's a combination of factors i think anyway i 'm trying to think
no
i do n't uh i think personally actually but you know what
i wo- i work for bethlehem steel
i 'm retired now
and now uh i 'm going to lose part of my pension
and um there 's various factors there
but one of the factors is that the stock market has done so poorly
the funds in our plan they 're not very high now
so
right
sure
i remember that
mhm
mhm
right
absolutely
it 's obscene is n't it
yeah
that 's obscene
you got it
yeah
does n't seem right does it
that 's it
right
mhm
you got it
i always wondered about it myself
yeah
mhm
right
right
mhm
yeah
yeah
i do n't think so
it it 's just um more regulation and more regulation
and it 's not very good either
i mean th- that causes as many problems
yeah
mhm
mhm
that 's no good either
mhm
mhm
that 's a problem right there
some people are not basically honest
and we just have to hope that you know that it happens
we 're in bankruptcy right now
but um that was a long time coming
it actually started in the eighties
okay
and i work outside all the time
i have a dog kennel
and i have to be outside all the time
i 'm in oklahoma
uh-huh
where are you
clear the other side
yeah
i bet you 're not outside
yep
and i 've never been ice skating in my life
yeah
and i 'm outside every day of the year
with the dogs i have to be out
so
uh about seventy-five
no
i raise uh maltese lhasa apsos uh poodles and pomeranians
yeah
all the little fuzzy things
yeah
i sell them
i have a buyer in uh up in seattle washington
i have a buyer in phoenix arizona
and i have one down in houston texas
so that i i ship them out
and
uh
years
yes it is
yes it is
i 've been doing it for thirty years
so i 've been outside a lot
but it 's not bad in oklahoma
it was nice tod- it was just jacket weather here today
it was really nice outside
do you have snow
you do have snow
you do
mm see
and i hate snow
i hate snow
uh not a lot
um i do n't know
it probably does something i 'd say
ten days to the year
snow you know sleet something
but but i hate it
because it 's not year round we do n't drive well in it here
you know it 's not something we 're used to all the time
mhm
yeah
and see i did n't i did n't grow up with it
i was raised in lodi california and a- and then came to oklahoma
so
so i do n't like snow
i i like oklahoma
i really like oklahoma
and most of the time i like the weather
but i just do n't like snow
but i it 's a good place to have a family
that there 's not a lot of you know the crime and stuff
we live out in the country in a little rural area
and it 's really really nice here
well my daughter was a flag girl in the band on the for football
so we were outside at the football games at night in freezing weather
yeah
i guess when you 're young you do n't notice it
i like to read
and uh i do n't know
listen to music and things like that
i guess if i 'm outside i rollerblading is probably the most typical one
oh wow
really
so where where are you from
in oklahoma
oh well right now i 'm in new york
but i 'm from los angeles
but i 'm a teacher
so yeah
yeah
i went from coast to the other
but um i like new york
i 've only been in new york for about um a couple of months i guess
i moved here in september
um and right now it 's really really cold
so it 's not a good time to do outdoor activities
no
no
not at all
although i did go uh ice skating at rockefeller center during the holidays
and that was nice
it was fun
eh i 'm not very good at it
but uh i had a good time falling eh falling down and drinking hot chocolate
now how many dogs do you have in your kennel
seventy-five
and are they all of like one particular breed
wow
wow
so all of the like toy dogs
and do you raise them for for competitions
or do you raise them for sales
or
wow
and how did you get started in in this business of breeding dogs
it 's a long story
wow
oh
that 's good
that 's good
yeah
it 's been freezing here recently
it 's been so so cold
we 've had a cold snap
and uh it 's been really like into the some days into the twenties
and at night getting down into the teens
so but it 's nice
it 's a good change from from california and from los angeles
and to sort of
sit in my apartment and watch the snow fall
yeah
yeah
we 've had a we have n't had a lot of snow
but but we 've had a couple of good snowfalls with some flurries
and
really
but do you get a lot of snow in oklahoma
yeah
yeah
right
right
yeah
i suppose it 's like when it rains in in l. a.
when it rains in l. a. people just forget how to drive because it hardly ever rains there
so that but i mean i like snow now
but probably just because it 's my first winter of seeing snow falling
and and so it 's still beautiful for me
i 'm still in that stage of like oh it 's so beautiful
but i talk to people who 've lived here their whole lives
or my mom is originally from chicago
and she used to always tell me that the best thing to ever happen to her was moving to california
she got away from the chicago winters
i think maybe if you grow up with it it 's not so nice
oh wow
yeah
mhm
n- da-
well i imagine there must be a lot of opportunities for outdoor activities in there
probably more so than here
because living in a big city i guess you do n't have a lot of possibilities
you have to kind of get out of the city in order to do any really outdoorsy type stuff
yeah
that 's something you can do when you 're young
when i was in high school i was on the pep squad
and i just never remember feeling cold or you know being up there in those little skirts
you do n't
you really do n't
it 's fun
and you get out there
but when when you get older you start to think hm it 's not so nice being out
you know i have a um few friends
but a lot of acquaintances
where i people i call friends
i stay i 'm real close with do anything for
got a lot of acquaintances where eh you know i 'll talk to them socialize with them
but do n't go overly friendly with them
um you know it 's uh it 's kind of hard when you get so close to people
and then all of a sudden uh you uh something they do or something they say c- bothers you then you have to feel obligated
in cases with your friends you got to accept what they say
th- you 're afraid to hurt their feelings if you speak what 's on your mind and are afraid to f- lose that friendship that you value
no
i agree
i mean i um used to when i was younger
uh in my teens i had tons of friends
and that 's exactly right
you seem like you hang around with them
and they and they start asking
and then before you know it you ask them for help
and they 're like well you ca n't
then you it causes uh animosity
it causes uh tension between the two uh people pick up pretty quick
um you know but uh as i get older i 'm finding that uh having having friends is important
i call my wife my best friend
because if i have anything that i can i have on my mind or that i have to do i can call her or talk to her and she 's there for me
well that 's good
i mean y- you know that 's uh that means that uh you bond with them beyond um what w- some people call um
children raise children children are there just to help them out around the house doing chores and stuff
not to be friends
we have a six year old little girl who 's my stepdaughter
and she 's i 've told her since day one i 'll never be your dad
but i 'll always be your best friend
and i preach that to her on almost on a daily basis
where you value your friends
and that you do n't you 're not selfish with your friends
because she tries to be very um overbearing and very selfish
with if they bring a toy she wants to play with it and wo n't let her wo n't let them play with her toys
so i tell her i try to preach on her just how much you value friends and how ch- how much you should cherish it
right
unfortunately the way that people are though and when i see these commercials they think friendship 's all about partying
and they do n't understand that there 's a true value to it
that if you have a friend that you someone in your life you do call a friend that you should something to be valued not just to go out and have fun with
you 're there for the rough times and bad times and good times
that that 's that 's they need that
i mean you know we have a nephew who um hung around with the wrong crowd
and unfortunately he had to pay a couple mon- well a year and a half in juvenile uh detention for it
but now he 's o- he 's nineteen now
and he realizes he 'll never do it again
and he said yeah
it was the bad thing at the time
but now it 's a good thing because he realized what he had
and the right friends to hang around
yep
yeah
i
well that 's always there
i that 's good
i mean y- i can tell you that 's something that they you know all of us sh- uh should learn to value to have that
um you know like i say i have a a few friends
but um a ton of acquaintances
people you talk to on a daily basis but you wo n't go out of your way for on a you know on a r- on a limb
you would never but the people i do call friends i cherish
you know y-
oh yeah
i mean ag- again i could tell you um you know well my wife has a friend that you know she 's my wife is a a divorced woman with a child before i came around ha- she had a friend whose child 's like a year and a half younger than ours
i call her more than mine because um i feel like i 'm her father in every way
but uh you know she um
um i guess i 'll start
i have a i have a lot of friends
some are nice
some are bad
some are crazy
i just i like all kinds of people
i do n't have any enemies
yup
i found that um do n't do too much for your friends because some will take advantage of you and not appreciate what you do for them
so i 'm kind of wary on helping friends out like i used to
yeah
i feel the same way
yeah
ah i 'm not married
but my kids are my best friends
right
ah
yeah
i try and teach my kids right too
and i teach them not to be judgmental of other people
and just to be nice
not to let people walk all over them though
yeah
i 'm that
i 'm pretty lucky
my kids hang out with the good crowd
i have um five kids
and four of them have a lot of friends
my youngest is a one-year old
but my twelve-year old he 's r- right in with the good kids
the th- high um high eh well i do n't know how to say it
but the kids who play a lot of sports
the kids who are um achieve highly achieved in school
and they 're just the good crowd
i know they 're going to get far
yeah
yep
sometimes the things they learn and the lessons they have to go through make them better people
or you know teach the kids good lessons
my kids my kids have n't been in too much trouble except for with me
yeah
but
yeah
my oldest he has some really good friends
his one friend 's dad is a lawyer
and he 's just right up there with the good kids
yep
i have one good friend
and i used to do everything for her
lend her money
give her things
and she does n't appreciate anything
she would just take take and take and not even appreciate it
and now i have an old friend that moved up to the apartments i live in
and she is the kind that wo n't ask for anything
she wo n't use you
and she 's she 's up here
no furniture
two kids
and i 've i 'm going through everything to give her what she can what i think she can use because she wo n't ask
she 's so nice
and she 's very quiet
but i 've been calling around for furniture for her and everything
and she appreciates even if you gave her some used dishes or anything
she 's happy
aw
s- same here
uh uh i prefer uh italian
yeah
mm
th- that 's my preference
a- although i 've i i 'm up for ah about uh anything really
bu- basically tha- that 's right
yeah
uh n- you know
oh really
mhm
wow
uh e- oh
certainly
yeah
sa- same here
y- you know
uh yeah uh well i- i- if it 's prepared correctly i- it should n't be overbearing
i- it does
but um i- it again n- you know i- if it 's prepared correctly uh th- the garlic should not be n- you know strong
i- it it should just be a uh mild uh background ki- kind of a taste
um yeah
i- exactly
y- y- you know just a little dash more or less
y- yeah
um b- beings tha- that i 'm a non drinker ah ty- typically i do n't drink wine
uh it uh only on very rare occasions
n- you know i- if i eat dinner at e- you know ah a- at a wedding or uh what have you will i have a uh glass of wine or champagne
e- you know but t- typically um i i i 'm not a wine person
mhm
mhm
ah for for ten minutes
yeah
yeah
ah i 'm from ah pittsburgh pennsylvania
yeah
yeah
but basically uh p- penn state the the main campus is roughly mm ah uh we- oh ro- roughly about a hundred miles away from me
yeah
s- so it 's
hm
you know eh in the ball park
e- oh
oh
mm
mhm
oh yeah
oh
wow
th- that 's great
yeah
i i have some family down in houston
and uh a- also i i have a couple relatives in stafford texas as well
and uh i i 've been down there eh a couple times
eh you know uh i i do like texas
ho- however i 've ne- you know to live there i i 'm not sure if i would want to do that
but um oh

a- and th- that 's about it
yeah
right
aw
hot and muggy
y- you know v- very humid
y- you know
italian
mm as long as you do n't have to cook it
but i say
i really like mexican food
but i ca n't eat it very often because it- i have an ulcer
so they i ca n't really eat it
but i love it because i live right by the mexican border
and it 's all over down here
but i do like italian too
i had a problem with just anything red for a while
but i like italian food
definitely
something b- beyond just spaghetti
eating anything with cheese
i like alfredo sauce
i do n't think i 've ever had pesto though
i do n't think i 'd like it because i do n't like basil quite that much
it has a lot of garlic in it too does n't it
just a hint
i 've seen it made
and it seemed like they used a lot of garlic
but i really i like garlic
it 's good for you too
it 's good for your heart they say
i do n't know
there 's a lot of garlic pills on the market i see
so uh what about do you like wine with your italian food
i 'm not super fond of wine
every once in a while
not i do n't really i do n't drink too often because it 's kind of another no no
so well my my stomach does n't really like alcohol either
so oh come on
how long are we supposed to talk
do you have any idea
is that so
oh
w- part of the country are you from
really
so you 're in the area where the study is taking place
oh really
i 've i 've been through pennsylvania
i do n't think i was ever i do n't think i ever went to pittsburgh
i 'm pretty sure i did n't
uh we went to the it was a tourist thing
we went to the pennsylvania dutch country
so it was in that part
but it was really beautiful there
i 'm from california
really
huh
yeah
no
it- i live in california not texas
yeah
no i that 's all right
i i do n't think i would want to live in texas either
i 've been through
there 's just not a whole lot but oil refineries and lots of smelly cows and and nothing
yeah
that that that 's it
and texans
which they 're all right
but

eh yeah
well you know eh stress does it too
you talk about talking yourself into or getting yourself sick from the way you think
stress will do it to you too
it just wrecks your immune system
you get a
you know school jobs that sort of thing
relationships
that makes you sick
that 's one that 's one thing about the w- the weather
you know things there 's a lot of holidays in the fall
i do n't know
maybe a lot of people get stressed out over the holidays
i do n't think i 'm one of them
but uh that 's a contributing factor
and then everybody goes inside
you know and the air 's all stale and dust and stuff
you know
hm
mhm
yeah
i d- me neither
i i i hate it
uh you i i i try to eat well also
i 'm i do n't i really do watch what i eat
i i probably about twenty percent of the stuff i get is organic food
i i buy a lot of stuff at the grocery store
but sometimes especially some of the stores around here you can go to the sa- eh like wild oats
you can go down there
and a lot of the organic stuff will be on sale for less than the regular stuff is at the grocery store
and i 'll just buy that uh since there 's one of those stores nearby
pretty close
i 'm twenty-five miles away
where where are you a- where are you
oh okay
i 'm in loveland
yeah
yeah
planet boldar
nobody gets sick down there
people 's republic of boulder
i like boulder
i 'd live there except it 's too expensive
it is nice
i like it a lot
yeah
it 's really good
you know the air 's better here
i think that keeps me healthier
you got that denver denver boulder metro area air
ours is n't really good
p- i mean it 's not perfect
but it 's a a little bit better
we 're sort of in between fort collins and boulder
so we and since the air comes from the west we have fresher air
yeah
mhm
yeah
well i 'm originally from the southeast
and it 's the same sort of thing only down there you know they do n't really know how to do winter
yeah
mhm
yeah
well i 'm in colorado
and uh same kind of thing
um it uh eh the weather can very greatly
like uh eh even in january we can have fifty and sixty degree weather
or we could have
like
yeah
are you around here too
oh
coo-
wondered when you said skiing
but um
yeah
i i mean they had that little quote that it lasts seven days or a week depending on if you go to the doctor or not and stuff
and i mean i 'm one of those people like flu shots and stu- i 've never gotten i 've never got a flu shot in my life
and i never get the flu
yeah
same here
same here
oh
that stinks
yeah
yeah
but uh no
i mean i uh i b- i believe very strongly in um in mind over matter when it comes to illness and stuff
in that that people i think can talk themselves into being sick sometimes
that uh and i think some people look for an excuse to be sick because they 're sick of work or something like that
you know and so they start getting a little headache or a sniffle or something
and they talk them- they like oh i must be getting a cold
and i think just by saying that sometimes you talk yourself into getting more and more sick
and you um whereas if you just say oh it 's a he- whatever it 's a headache
you know maybe i 'm not drinking enough water because you know how dry it is out here and stuff
um i think so
yeah
yeah
yeah
um so uh
yeah
i just i mean for for me i i i just believe in being healthy you know and eating well and stuff and and just not not admitting that i that i might be getting sick
i mean when yo- when i really get sick it 's obvious
and like you said i i do n't think i 've been really sick for years
but when you 're when you 're really sick your body tells you
i eh i mean you ca n't get out of bed you know because uh because for whatever reason you h- you have no energy
or the you know it 's you d- you do n't just have a headache
you have the chills
i mean it 's pretty obvious
and so um i do n't know
i just i do n't have time to be sick
eh are you anywhere near boulder
uh where are you
i mean i 'm in boulder
so
i mean you 're talking about you 're talking about w-
oh
oh
cool
cool
no
but y- you talk about organic food and stuff
and i was like that 's that 's all that we 're about in boulder
you know s-
that 's right
yeah
i know
i- it is expensive
but loveland 's c- loveland 's a great place
loveland 's nice
yup
definitely
yeah
well that 's m- that 's very true
no
i grew i grew up in the midwest where it was a lot more humid and stuff
and it seemed like it was i felt like it was easier to get sick there
maybe maybe i 'm totally off base
but um i just i mean i hated the weather there
it was just oppressive and i- e- so h- so humid and wet in the summer and and and stuff
and so
um i do n't know
i do n't know if if germs flourish better in the humid air or what
but
um
yes it does
i was uh feeling all congested and everything for a week
fred could you bring me my cough drops please so i do n't cough at barbara thank you and uh just like four days ago i went to the doctor
and i was feeling fine
and then i started coughing
and i have n't stopped since
and i 've been taking vitamin c.
my mother always says take vitamin c. drink lots of orange juice and lots of fluids
but i think my problem is i 'm not getting enough sleep
oh
nyquil
um
i tried it one time
and it did n't really work for me
but i did uh buy robitussin
and um that 's supposed to make you stop coughing
no
yeah
yeah
well what i did was i was going away for uh yesterday
and i called my doctor and explained the situation and said i needed um a prescription if she could give me one
and she was going to give me something that had codeine in it a syrup
but i was n't able to get it because she never called it in before i left
i guess she waited until she was done with with her patients for the day
and it was too late
and i got home too late tonight
so tomorrow i have to go get my prescription
i mean because i always thought to myself i do n't know how people you know could just die from being congested
but when i was coughing earlier today i could n't breathe
i had so much like congestion in my chest
it was blocking the airway
and i was really uh worried about it
then i mean uh my husband came in
that 's it
i was in the bathroom with these tears running down my eyes just from the constant cough cough cough cough cough
yes
i know
my mother always tells me you got to round your shoulders
but um for this the doctor said really the only thing you can do is drink the fluids
drink the orange juice
and try to get the rest
just stay in bed
but it 's just you know it 's impossible for people to stay in bed these days
everybody has so much to do
yeah
well you sound like you 're well
and you 're not uh sick right now
so whatever you 're doing it 's working
whatever you 're doing is working
oh
you know i had a flu shot this year for the first time in my life
yes
but um
oh
it 's like i noticed my husband he was starting to cough
and i was telling him i give him extra vitamin c. because he 's insulin dependent
i are you
okay
so i was afraid he would get
oh okay
no
no
but that might work
because i was really afraid if he got sick that uh it would be bad
so i really have to watch his health
mhm
yeah
and like
uh
yes
yes
oh
it does
see when i was in the store today i bought more more cough drops at eckerds
and uh they had the you know cherry flavored which is what i got
but they also had a sugar free
but i did n't get them because i know he would n't eat them anyway
and there 's five less in the bag
so
i might as well get thirty for the same money
oh
they open up the passages and everything
yes
oh
okay
because uh
because the only time he ever tried them they were those when when they had the original ones that are really repulsive
but you know i found that those are those are the most effective
right
let me ask you a question
i was thinking about going back to the old vick 's vaporub for your chest
does that work
do you still use it for your kids
and it helps them
oh
okay
because i have n't used that in years
but i was so desperate for something that would work
oh my god
that could be
do you ever tried that nyquil
ah
no
sometimes it does
sometimes it does n't
i know when um my daughter was little and she has asthma so we used to have to get her cough medicine with codeine because that 's the only thing that would stop
yeah
yep
but that 's what that 's the only thing that i found that works is something with codeine
that that bad where it 's persistent i do n't think anything else does work
oh
yeah
y- you have all you can do to breathe
yeah
you ca n't breathe and cough too
you have to d- either one or the other
you know
and if you do n't stop pretty soon your ribs are going to be nice and sore
yeah
i think that 's right
stay in bed
yes
i do n't know
if you have a little kid you really ca n't stay in bed
you know if you have a two-year old or f- i watch a two-year and a four-year old
it 's like i ca n't stay in bed
i i 'm up and going
and it 's like no
i 'm i 'm not sick right now
but
huh
took my flu shot
did you
i 'll be darned
but usually if i get a good you might as well just you might as well just whistle dixie because it 's um if i get sick then i 'm i 'm screwed so to speak because i 'm also a diabetic
so it 's like if i get sick then i i have other things to to tend to
oh
no
i 'm not
i 'm just um
how about echinacea
have you tried echinacea
echinacea is another thing to ward off colds
oh
yeah
because then
yeah
because it 's like if you get sick it 's like you 're screwed as a diabetic because you ca n't take this
and you ca n't take that
and it 's ra ra ra ra ra ra ra
but i do see i do see they have robitussin now for diabetics
and that does work
yeah
it does work
yup
right
yup
well if you get the if you get the halls
the sugar free
tell him they do n't taste bad
they do work
and they do n't taste bad
they taste
yeah
the w- the um in the halls cough drops like you get the bag full
and it 's and eh sugar free
you can get them sugar free in halls
and tell him they do work
and they do n't taste bad
they taste
they 're nasty
tell him i would n't eat them either
they 're they are positively nasty
yeah
but they 're nasty
and who wants to eat nasty things
i still use it
yes
i do
and clears that nose so you can at least breathe
oh what was that other thing
um use use vicks
it ca n't hurt you
mhm
yeah
i would n't be surprised
well uh as far as overeating goes um i mean i l- i like to eat all the time
i 'm not overweight either
but i like to eat you know like maybe four or five times a day
it depends
you know i 'll eat um just on the go all the time it seems like
but um and and i 'm sh-
yeah
yeah
well yeah
there that is a problem these days
uh oh uh uh america is uh a lot of americans are overweight
but what really uh mm what
in school
mhm
mm there 's no doubt that uh t. v. has had a big impact on uh on the social life
that 's true
mhm
right
right
well it 's much much better for the imagination development you know to to get out and play games and and all that too
i did too
i w- i 'm fifty-five now
but um
uh
yeah
yeah
well that 's true
you know the eh people uh eh you know do get uh g- uh can be uh you know hurtful uh that way
but uh smoking is the one that really bugs me
i used to be a smoker
uh but i quit about twenty years ago
yup
and so uh i 'm amazed
we 're from california
and i 'm amazed how many people still smoke here in philadelphia in uh this part of the country
mhm oh
yeah
i remember all those ads
my father used to smoke too
eh l. s. m. f. t.
you know lucky strikes
oh yeah
yeah
it 's it
it is awful tough
i 'm telling you
i know
uh when when our kids were little one time we went into a store
and the price of a carton of cigarettes had just gone up to ten dollars a carton
and i just thought that was awful
you know we were having a tough time young family and everything
and i said i just can not spend that kind of money taking taking the food out of these kids ' mouths
so i just quit
yeah
um uh there 's recently been some news about portions of of food that you eat
eh that people are eating too much at one time
and as far as i am concerned i never was a big eater
i 'm no- i 'm not a very heavy person
i do n't eat very large portions at one time
and they claim that overweight people that eats a lot has a shorter lifespan
mhm
yeah
i hear you
well er it it does seem like that um as far as children and um and these uh like mcdonald 's and places uh they serve such big hamburgers for a small child
and and they say a lot of children are overweight
which i can i can see from my childhood
when we was growing up the um did n't seem like there was many that many overweight children as there are today
mhm
and uh i do n't really think they exercise like we did when we was young because of um
oh
well anytime because of these um um games they play and t. v.
and all these nintendo games uh instead of getting out and playing like like we used to when i was a kid
i 'm well i 'm fifty-nine now
mm um back when i was a youngster we did n't have all those games
so we had to get out and play instead of set in the house and play those games
you know
mhm
eh yeah
i can uh i ca- go by my grandchildren
uh eh eh instead of getting out they like to set around the t. v. or play those games i- instead of getting out and playing
so
now gossip um talking about gossip
i think that is one of the things that hurt more people than you know that 's that 's good
um
mhm
yes
uh-huh
oh
did you
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
well i 'm i 'm still a smoker
uh uh i 'm not not for it and would like to quit
but uh we was raised on a farm
and and back when i was rai- uh growing up uh you know it 's it was on television that uh winston tastes good like a cigarette should
you know
mm
yeah
oh yeah
it 's one of the harder things i 've ever tried to quit
and uh and i 've uh attempted it two or three times
and i would like to do it again
but um so far i have n't been able to break the habit
and i know i know it 's a bad habit
mhm
mhm
yeah
uh-huh
well that 's that 's th- that 's one of the bigger things right now with me
well i do n't watch too much reality t. v.
i do n't really like it
um i do n't know
i 'm thinking uh i- i- it 's different
eh maybe they want to live in japan
i do n't know
i think of it as being kind of like japanese t. v.
which which i 've never seen
but i 've d- i 've i 've seen crazy shows that are supposedly from japan where they show excerpts
you know i never caught the name
but i saw things that looked a lot like what we 're seeing now
they dump spiders on people and do weird things
so uh
or creating conflicts eh like the survivor shows
yep
yeah
that 's the only one i saw
i saw a few episodes where they tended they tended to do uh create conflicting or conflict and put people into the situations
and i guess you 're right
they started to add uh add more uh sexual tension as the time went on
yeah
yes
yeah
yeah
i do n't know
you know i suppose
i never got the interest in watching someone else do it either
that 's the thing
but uh
or they or they pull over on the side of the road to watch an accident
yeah
i
yes
i would agree with that
eh uh yeah
but um i i i think that maybe it 's the quality that has n't really attracted me
and i i 'm wondering
i do n't know what the age group is
um you know i 'm in the i 'm in my fifties
so i do n't know what the age group is of people that are really active
but i 'm thinking back
uh you know eh when i was young eh you know the shows that were really popular that people watched
um generally you know they watched them because they were in groups and got excited together
you know maybe after work or something like that
i c- i c- i ca- i can honestly remember that the wheel of fortune was extremely popular for some reason
but then people were in bars and drinking and smoking
and
i do too
but i have n't watched it in a long time
and i remember that that was when it was
yeah
jeopardy i jeopardy challenges you
but uh
and why are n't they called reality shows i wonder
well i guess because they 're edited
but th- so are the other ones
and what 's more real than that
but what game shows or the sh- the reality shows
well but they 're scripted by ar- well i do n't know
maybe i 'm wrong on this
i was under the impression that they may be scripted and controlled but but controlled by outside parties not the parties involved themselves
so they do n't really know
they they they put people together in in anticipated conflict or an anticipated situation
they do n't really know how the people will react
a- and and then they edit it
and then of course at the end you get a prize
it 's kind of a game show
you think the participants are involved
i have no idea
i mean they eh do n't seem to be talking
for
okay
yeah
th- i did n't hear them mention that on the tape they sent me with
but but eh but uh
i 've seen the commercials for it
and he 's apparently uh v- poor
right
right
right
yeah
not fifty million dollars
right
well the show was all filmed before the commercials were done
so uh
um i 'm wi- i 'm with you on that
um so so that answers the first question
um i think the second question was uh why does everyone else
all right
i do n't i do n't know too mu-
you mean like anime
okay
well so eh there 's there 's uh to my mind there 's a couple pieces
one of which is there 's a ki- uh uh um there 's a a prurient uh interest um in a lot of them
a lot of them have to do with uh uh eh people getting together uh intimately and um and then uh fighting about it huh if you will
which is
yeah
creating conflict
tha- that- th- that 's that 's that 's how they started if you remember
you know they 'd y- you know so into the there 'd be like
right
right
and eh eh well what they what they then added on was disgusting stuff like uh eating worms and putting your head into a bowl full of beetles and that kind of garbage
which is uh you know the kind of thing that uh you would n't want to do yourself
but it 's it 's kind of interesting i guess watch-
and uh a- and then you go from there to the the dangerous ones where somebody could theoretically actually get hurt
um which is which is always popular
i mean that 's why people go to circuses
you know to watch the
these peo-
sure
so there 's there 's a basic human nature element uh the the uh r- r- uh rubber necking element i think
you- your thoughts
yeah
uh i mean basically what it is is voyeurism as far as i 'm concerned
right
yup
yup
okay
well i actually kind of like the wheel of fortune because
uh i i i i 'm good at it
it 's like jeopardy
um i 'm good at i 'm good at word games
eh
yeah
uh
eh well they 're not
um they 're
well eh no
they 're they 're they 're game shows
um you know it 's a game
and y- and you get a prize
whereas these other things are people
eh eh i a- actually i 'd i would i would liken it more to uh wrestling
where it where it 's it 's scrip-
reality shows
where it 's scripted
well yeah
i
eh eh uh eh i i i 'd i suppose so
uh yeah
uh
kind kind of
um eh my my suspicion is that they 're highly scripted
um
yeah
i eh
uh and uh uh w- well for example the uh they mentioned on the on the tape here uh joe millionaire
oh
okay
i i do n't know if you 've seen any of the commercials for it
i mean some con- some construction guy from new jersey
all right
so fine
nothing wrong with that
all right
now are you going to tell me that the women involved have n't seen any of these commercials
okay
yeah
no kidding
yeah
oh no
i i watch it
um not as much as like i i watch uh you know the real world road rules um lately uh uh the bachelor that kind of stuff a little bit more
just because uh um uh survivor 's always on when friends is
and i never miss that show
yeah
oh do you
okay
wow
where 's uh wher- just out of curiosity where 's lodi
because i 'm actually originally from uh oregon
yeah
oh yeah
sure
okay
all right
yeah
i just i just moved to texas
i had to drive through that area to uh move from uh portland over here
oh wow
okay
sure
wow
yeah
that 's cool
okay
so is uh survivor like your favorite reality show then i guess
yeah
that 's right
oh yeah
yeah
um the eh the bachelorette
yeah
okay
okay
yeah
i yeah
i 've i 've i 've caught a litle bit of uh the the um american idol
uh bachelor i 've seen a little bit
i 've probably seen almost all the um
but i missed the one where like uh last night or the night before just because of uh work commitments
but
yeah
oh yeah
uh yeah
joe millionaire
yeah
it is
but i actually do n't watch it eh so much as uh you know interest just to kind of make fun of the guy because he 's kind of a he reminds me of puddy a lot from seinfeld
so just kind of just kind of eh one of those things i like to watch with friends and just eh kind of rip on him the whole time
yeah
yeah
no kidding
and plus it 's it 's always nice to see kind of like average people um you know eh starring in something rather than uh some celebrities
you know it 's always it 's nice to see them kind of adapt
and and i just kind of like how the the realism
eh you know
yeah
oh yeah
yeah
oh yeah
a bulldozer driver or something like that
yeah
he says something about like this reminds me of eh driving bulldozers
and she was kind of like what
yeah
i saw that too
no kidding
i heard that one 's pretty short though
it 's like it 's going to be wrap up eh here like in the next week or two i think
oh
does he really
oh
okay
i did n't know he blew it already
wow yeah
i i feel sorry for half those girls there on the show
i mean perhaps there 's a riot
they 're going after his money
but
uh i know
yeah
oh man
oh that 's right
yeah
yeah
they always have eh it 's kind of cool with survivors
how they i mean it 's never like with a lot of shows like especially with sit-coms they run from like you know october to may
and the- they 're done for like four or five months
with survivor seems like they eh they run it for three four months
they take like a month or two off
and they ha- a new new episode or a new uh a new run going
so that 's kind of cool
yeah
yeah
yeah
no kid-
i heard
and also there 's a lot more i mean obviously the other ones make it they 're in the the swahili 's you know jungle and that kind of stuff before
but i heard like in this one there 's like you know piranhas and all kinds of other
yeah
oh yeah
no kidding
yeah
oh yeah
yep
yep what was
yeah
what was your favorite one so far
i guess the survivor the very first one
or
yeah
that 's the one i most identify with the show too
i mean with uh richard
and um and uh that that
yeah
i think we all were
i do n't know who was pulling for him
yeah
i was kind of pulling for rudy uh even though he got bumped off because he uh just all of a sudden out of nowhere just took his hand off that pole or whatever
yeah
oh really that 's cool
yeah
and uh
yeah
i watch reality shows
i i watch the um survivor show particularly
i pretty much enjoy that
i just think it 's kind of an interesting thing to do
yeah
and di- did you watch the survivor shows
uh-huh
yeah
i watched the ba- eh wa- wa- watched the bachelor shows because my my i have two teenaged daughters
yeah
and
from oregon
well you know where sacramento is do n't you
yeah
just about forty minutes from s- from uh sacramento to the uh south
y- yeah
i used to live in clovis new mexico
that 's just a short ways from texas
yeah
right in the middle over by muleshoe
amarillo albuquerque in between there
yeah eh uh survivor is my favorite one
i 've i 've watched like the um american idol
and i watch watched that with my teenage daughters
now they 're involved in the second one which just started
yeah
and um what was the other one i watched
oh now that they 've got that one where the girl 's picking the guys
yeah
the eh
yeah
the bachelorette one
they 're watching that
uh-huh
yeah
and then they got that one where the guy 's supposed to be worth fifty million dollars
have you watched that at all
yeah
that 's pretty funny
uh-huh
oh
i i kind of like them because it 's a change of pace you know from the typical sit-coms and news shows and magazine shows that kind of thing
just just something for entertainment
yep
yeah
and um there 's another one out eh now
oh that one that w- where he 's supposed to be worth fifty million dollars
you know that they just made it up
he uh eh they showed on the preview that he he slipped and let- lets it out the he used to be a or that he was um what is it a crane operator or or a bulldozer operator or something like that
yeah
so i 'm kind of curious to see what happens there
yeah
it 's a- it 's almost done because i think he blew it and everybody knows
yeah
oh well
you know
and survivor 's going to um the amazon
i guess it starts eh in about a couple weeks or so
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i 'm kind of looking forward to seeing the amazon one though
just to i guess they got the guys against the girls this time which is something different
y- yeah
eh i 'd i 'd really i 've always kind of wanted to go there myself
so i- i- in a way it 's kind of like getting to see what it 's like a little bit
you know it 's k- pretty much what i like about it
you know the one where they were l- on on the island i thought that was kind of neat
probably the first
yeah
yeah
i wa- i was mad that richard won
but what the heck
i could n't believe he won actually
uh-huh
and my whole family has to watch it
i mean when it 's on we all have to watch it
so
yeah
we 're hooked
yeah
well they found some stuff
but
not a- not a lot
i mean there was some empty warheads i guess that that were used for like biological weapons
yeah
i know a lot of people are n't
but i i think you know it 's i just know that they have other information that i do n't have about what he 's actually up to
you know
and he ca n't really just necessarily say everything on the t. v. about what they know
so i do n't th- i do n't think bush would do this just for getting his father 's legacy resolved
do you know what i mean but uh but i do think if it 's necessary we should go in there and do whatever we need to do
but i know a lot of people do n't
well just get saddam out of there is what i think
but
no
yeah
right
right
right
and i 'd hate to see a lot of loss of life even on our side
you know
hm
yeah
yeah
yeah
right
yeah
yeah
right
yeah
that 's true
and then eh i think he learned that lesson with i would have thought anyway with north korea calling them axis of evil
and then here there are mm you know upset with us and threatening to use nuclear weapons
and i do n't know
uh-huh
yeah
right
i agree with you
i would hope it would be somewhat like um the first war eh with iraq that it would n't be there would n't be a lot of loss of life
but you know they say that there has to be ground forces going in this time
so
uh-huh
right
yeah
he has a lot of support there for some reason
i 'm not sure why
yeah
yeah
that 's tr-
right
right
yep
oh my goodness
uh-huh
huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i did n't know that either
well
yeah
i mean i think that they should they should check for arms
i mean i have n't been following it exactly
but i guess they 've been looking
and g- they have n't found anything
and i guess
oh
did it
yeah
some stuff
yeah
yeah
but i do n't know
in general i i 'm not in favor of uh war with iraq
i think
yeah
yeah
that 's that 's true
right
well i mean up to what level
i mean to like blow up the whole country or to g- just get out get saddam out of there
and
yeah
i do n't think there 's anything wrong with that
like i do n't i do n't really think he 's any kind of good guy or any kind of good leader
so
um
yeah
it would n't be too bad to see him go
the i mean the thing is like
yeah
this guy 's really bad
and he 's bad to his own people
but it 's it 's going to be worse if like we do stuff that ends up killing the very people that he 's already causing trouble for
so i think
right
yeah
and the the only thing in the news that upset me recently is that uh you know f- france and germany made a declaration that they 're against the war
and then then the u- the u. s. like started digging on france and germany
and i was like that 's not the th- that 's not the right thing to do
and that 's the scary thing when the u. s. is like stopping no longer working with the rest of the world you know and and sort of making just uh offensive little comments
like they were saying that france and germany oh they represent old europe
you know it 's like hey france and germany 's a very modern society you know and in in many ways i think socially more advanced than the u. s. is
uh they have a lot less of a lot of the problems that we have
and you ca n't go around calling names to countries that maybe do n't have the economy and they 're not quite as powerful as us
but you ca n't you ca n't make enemies with the most powerful countries in europe
and
yeah
yeah
well you i mean the sad thing is that like people that have nothing to do with it when they get hurt i mean that 's not fair
like people like you and me who are n't making any decisions who are n't in charge of any policies you know it 's going to be people like us in the u. s. and in north korea and in iraq who 're going to get bombs falling down on them because of what the leader 's doing
i just think you should just throw all the leaders in a room together
and you know they should fight it out
and eh
yeah
in fact tha- that 's the bad thing about war
it 's going to hurt you know thousands and thousands of people that have no nothing to do with it
yeah
right
well but on the other hand i think there 's a possibility of taking certain measures that could get saddam to step down
now i know that 's not easy
on the other hand though like if you could convince if you can convince his military to no longer support him or like his advisors to turn against him i do n't know it 's still a pretty hard task
uh you know
yeah
yeah
i d- i do n't understand
i mean but you know people people only know as much as they 're being told
so
you know in in nineteen nineteen forties germany there was people supporting hitler that you know when it was all over they were like what the hell was i doing
uh they did n't realize
and i i 've been to uh to japan
and i i went to the the hiroshima memorial there
and i was really surprised to learn that like the people in japan had no idea what was going on during the worl- eh during the war
like when they had the kamikazes you know that the japanese soldiers were kamikazeing into the u. s. and whate- whatnot uh like the japanese people did n't know about that
and when things were turning against japan towards the end of the war the japanese press said that they were winning that like they were about to win the war and like conquer the u. s.
and so the actual people were totally uninformed
and if they knew that you know they had a very desperate position and that it probably was n't worth fighting anymore they would n't have kept fighting
and we would n't have had to end up dropping the bomb
but the people did n't even know what was going on
and so in a in a war situation it 's uh
hm
well y- you know the maybe they know something about what happened uh you know because iraq is a w- a very weird place
so i 'm not so sure uh you know uh that there is n't something of benefit for uh disarming them because the thing is uh uh they were among other things uh they were uh giving twenty-five thousand uh dollars to uh families uh uh of uh of people that bombed people
yeah
the car bombings in israel and stuff
yeah
so uh that alone uh makes the guy uh uh uh a nasty son of a bitch and very untrustworthy
it 's very much in the interest of the world to get the middle east settled
and if you could control iraq and iraq uh and iran uh from uh from uh uh t- arming the uh the terrorist groups that refuse to uh to enforce a settlement you could uh get a peace settlement there
because on the palestinian sides i 've been in israel and i know plenty of palestinians they can not talk in in uh because they will be killed
no
probably the reasons being that they 're actually afraid that iraq i- uh uh iraq uh because of the huge oil revenues uh could uh the eh the same as khadafi has tried to do
bec- but he does n't ha- you know he 's away from uh you know from the critical area and the other players in the oil business
uh iraq did go into kuwait
and they have a much more powerful army than saudi arabia
yeah
but they have n't gotten any better
yeah
but with the kind of oil revenues they had uh uh uh you know in the interim um would n't it be very easy for them to re-arm and be re- more in advanced position than they were before
that 's your eh that 's your problem
eh because uh you know intelligence does n't talk to the american people
if i- if iran was n't such a nasty cou- uh country i i would n't be in favor of going after them
well they 've k- he 's killed over a million of his own people
we- heh we we- heh we uh we we destroyed the taliban because eh you know they destroyed all the national monuments
he he destroyed uh he destroyed uh an arm- uh an area bigger than the everglades
yeah
eh you know uh uh environmentally
uh huh huh and treads tremendous damage to uh lots of species of of unique fish birds and animals that live there
well possibly because of what happened in nine eleven
they 're they 're they 're they if they ta- if they scare some of the other players uh uh you may end up uh with less problems like that
in the eh eh heh you know
i 'm not so sure about that
eh uh they said the same things about afghanistan
and it did n't destabilize the region
iraq does n't have any support in terms of their government
uh some of the european countries have a stronger economic interest than we do
i mean uh you 've got t- s- tremendous stability uh in uh in iraq and syria eh you know where very small minorities uh of like six or eight percent of the population sits on top of the other population and abuses them
syria is not a great a great place either in terms of uh human rights
but they 're a little quieter under the son than they were und- under the father
but these are very stable uh
right now is a critical time um to be considering the issue of disarming iraq
um especially i i especially do n't understand why they talk about disarming iraq before they even unders- or plu- prove
uh-huh
yeah
well wha-
oh you mean
eh eh in israel
okay
yeah
that 's that 's all i heard
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
okay
so the reason for pursuing um um pursuing the disarmament of iraq right now has to do with the money that they 're spending
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well that was in nineteen ninety-one though correct
well i do n't see why they would
i mean was n't the army pretty much destroyed after the gulf war
that 's possible
um it does n't seem li-
it does n't seem like that why would n't like if if our government knew that though why would n't they tell us
like
that seems a little strange to me
like it would seem to make this whole argument like so much easier for them if they could just tell us what the situation is
uh-huh
you mean iraq
yeah
well that 's true
i mean or that might be true
but it seems like
uh-huh
w-
uh-huh
you mean saddam hussein did
uh-huh
why is it right now though
why is it important to go after hussein
why not
so you think
but would n't people get very upset
if i mean is n't that what people are saying is that they 're going to get very upset if we go into iraq
and it 's going to destabilize the region
well i mean ev- g- afghanistan is also um seems to have had less support in terms of like their government than iraq
i mean there 's a lot of
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i see
april fool 's huh
oh
july fourth
yeah
my favorite holiday is christmas
well that 's the only time me and my entire family ever get together
yeah
yeah
well all my friends are in the military
so they 're never around whenever the fourth comes along
yeah
in oklahoma
really
yeah
i have no idea
i guess
hm
and what would it consist of
mhm
yeah
hm
mhm
mhm
yeah
mhm
uh political day
for all of us m- citizens that are not politicians can take the seat of a se- of a politician of a senator or a house rep for the day
and actually say yea or nay instead of letting them make the decisions for us
well i 'm a political consultant
so
and it 's like
mhm
exactly
well one thing bad is is if you 're a good researcher and you know what the bills are they 're already out there on the table and you 've researched them before that day comes then you know what you 're heading for
and instead of them bickering back and forth and everything else you can actually get people 's viewpoints and everything and just write it all down
and then whenever the l- legislation the senators all come back and go okay
what have you all decided
we can say yea or nay
uh-huh
instead of what they think we should think
exactly
uh-huh
exactly
no
july fourth
yeah
it 's festive
it 's in the summer
everybody gets a day off makes a long weekend out of it
a
yeah
that 's the normal way i would think
i would think
yeah
well i do n't really have much of an extended family
it 's just me and my mom
and she 's a mile and a half away
so christmas thanksgiving are h- holidays but really they 're more family oriented
whereas july fourth is more friends oriented and family
though you might get
oh
and well not lately especially
yeah
but uh i guess it 's also a question of where you 're at
where where do you reside
oh i 'm down here in frigid florida
yeah
last night it was like in the mid thirties
which for us is unheard of
and uh how long are these little interviews discussions supposed to
until we run out of steam
or or a li- little bell goes off or some such
i do n't know
creating a holiday
uh teachers ' day
if i had to create one
i think that 's
well we teachers ' day
i guess you 'd probably get a day off from school
how about a legal holiday in terms of business because i do n't know the economic repercussions of w- yet one more paid holiday on the economy
well it did n't actually probably say it had to be a legal holiday of sorts
so i do n't know how would you celebrate it
um i do n't know
thank that one teacher that gave you the inspiration to finish school i suppose
or something like that
or i remember i had a teacher like that who
well i do n't know without him i do n't know what might 've happened
but he did sort of kindle that i do n't know inquisitive mind
so i do owe him something
so that 's why i 'd probably pick a holiday in his profession
what holiday would you pick
or create
oh wow
that 'd that 'd really create chaos
hu-
oh no
i i like the idea
but oh a lot of a lot of places and a lot of political offices have uh you know mayor for a day kind of a thing
police chief for a day
but if you could actually sit down and actually participate in a vote that counted for real
yeah
but you know ho- you know how many political people would strategize and try to stack the deck for that one day
uh
it would be interesting
i give you credit for that
it would be
oh boy i 'd be tempted to vote a couple of yeas and nays
but uh yeah
i i guess if actually the people could actually
if their voices could actually be heard and the vote actually be based on what the constituency wants
i do n't know if that 'll ever happen
but it 'd be
be nice
yeah
i- i 'm sorry because now it 's all well i 'll vote for this if you 'll vote for that and you know well i 'll vote for this bill
but you got to put in this little thing where you know some of the money comes back to my district and all that kind of games
uh i think that 's a real good point
i do n't i think that 's uh i do n't know
with the eh high rate of divorces in this country i think that that 's that point is lost on a lot of people
and i do n't uh i do n't know what the right answer is
but boy i- if uh a lot more people have those views i think we 'd probably be a lot better off
i 've uh been only been married for uh five and a half years myself
but um i do n't know
even a lot of people that i 'm i 'm uh you know know and know of it 's almost like a mm convenience thing with them
and they 're not i do n't know if they take it seriously enough to uh you know make things last long term
good thought
yeah
that 's true
oh
congra- oh that 's great
w- we have two and one on the way
so
we 're uh and you 're right
i think um i do n't know
it 's tough to as you have kids and you know ha- having everything going on all the time
it- to me it 's you have to really m- make time to do that type of stuff because if not it wo n't happen
so uh we try to do the best we can
and make time for each other and have time to you know talk and communicate
and um eh you know it 's only half as fun a lot of times without the ki- the eh without the kids
but boy it 's
that 's right
exactly
i 'm the same way
eh i do n't know what it 's like to have a uh a quiet dinner anymore
if every now and then when we do i n- i do n't know what to think
i 'm in georgia
how about you
oh wow
oh no kidding
oh that 's great
wow
i was about to say everybody could fit in there
right
that 's great
y- alright
oh okay
and how ol- what are their- er how old are your kids
wow
so you do have a big range
right
oh okay
yeah
we have two
eh we had a miscarriage in between
actually no
t- to start off we had one miscarriage
and then i have a son that 's two and a daughter that 'll turn one next month
and then another one due in july
so she 's we 're only i think two and a half months along on the third one
so kind of crossing our fingers everything 's going to go well
that 's a good idea
oh neat
uh w- w- i guess for us uh having the same eh life goals and uh things that are important to you
uh my wife 's a christian
and i and eh so those it- uh strength and faith are eh things that guide us or uh help us link together
you know
true
be yeah
oh
yeah
w- uh one thing w- uh we try uh eh started early e- uh never to use the word divorce uh because you know once you say it it 's like you like kind of encourage it to come up again
so we try not to use that term
and and uh uh i guess the mutual uh aim to not just be partners but to work on your relationship and uh as friends
and uh you know uh i guess as as w- as kids come along we have six
so
uh we have
oh boy
yeah
ri- yeah
sometimes you feel like well what do we do now
we got we w- u- d- we do n't have any kids to do
yeah
so
yeah
eh uh where do you live
okay
in uh eh uh up in from n- north from chattanooga
in dayton
yeah
so
yeah
uh we ha- we bought a a seventeen foot canoe
it holds eleven hundred pounds
so we can all g- ride in it
yeah
and uh especially weight-wise
uh we usually u- have a couple of the mini lounge chairs that we put in there or recli- uh you know kind uh i guess lawn chairs they call them
oh we sent eh set a couple low rider types in the s- uh bottom of the canoe
so we can add extra spaces
so
and and usually my wife eh she 's eh uh she does n't she 's not a real water person
but she usually sits up on the bank and r- reads a book or eh something while we canoe back and forth
and we usually go um paddle down the river
we live a m- um about a mile half a mile from the tennessee river
so
from five to nineteen
yes
and we had uh two miscarriages in there also
and w- so we had the first two
h- the oldest boy 's nineteen
then we have a a seventeen year old girl
then we had a miscarriage
then we have a twelve year old girl who turned twelve in june
a boy that turned eleven in oc- no uh november
and then a nine year old in august
and then we had a miscarriage between her and the five year old eh that turned five in au- uh april
so
yeah
yeah
um yeah
w- so we uh like we uh when we can a- m- most of the time we eh scrunch in instead of going out to eat on friday nights or whatever
it 's uh kind of a home entertainment for us to make a homemade pizza
and we just make a w- a w- a h- eh bread recipe makes two loaves of bread
and we roll it out and roll it pretty thin and put a little cornmeal with it so that it does n't stick to the bottom of your pans
but we uh we make homemade pizza just about every friday night
to look for in a life partner i guess
yes
eleven years
eleven years
it was eleven years in december
i got married young
are you married
oh o-
okay
um
oh wow
oh wow
no throw it out
uh-huh
right
and so how long have you been with the the boyfriend you 're with now
oh okay
mhm
right
mhm
we did n't have that stage very long
we were eighteen when we got married
we dated about nine months before we got married
and it was a
we never really had that kind of stage
course we were both at weird t- times in our life too
that 's probably the reason we ended up getting married in the first place
probably for all the wrong reasons
what do you think
what d- what do you look for in a life partner cause i- i had never really given it any thought
i just
my husband was only my second relationship that had been anything substantial
and and i did n't i did n't really loo- i did n't have any specifications he had to meet or anything like that
i just sort of met him and immediately thought this was the one
and that was it
why this i do n't know
i do n't really know that there was anything specific to look for
mhm
oh yeah
yup
right
and that 's a good foundation to have
that 's the foundation that my husband and i needed when we got married and we did n't have
and it was not until you know maybe three or four years after we got married that we started to really put god first in our marriage
and if we 'd had him first in our relationship
yeah
i think that 's an excellent thing to look for in a possible life partner
it 's real hard to consider spending the rest of your life with somebody if if y- if they do n't have faith if you do n't have faith in god because then it just becomes you become a statistic i think
no
i had i had just grown up in a christian home
and he had n't basically
he really did n't have any kind of christian foundation at all
and uh he is just it was something he had never he 'd he had never been taught
never really had you know never really had any real good role models for that kind of thing
and so
uh really i 'm surprised our our he did n't really have eh views one way or the other
he was n't anti christian
but he was n't you know he just was n't a believer
so
it was and we did n't really fuss and fight about it either
it was n't really a i mean i knew where i was with my faith
but i d- at the time i really did n't um it did n't bother me that he did n't have a lot of faith
so
it was
mhm
mhm
right
are you are you married
really
wow
how
no ho ho ho ho
no
i 'm still i 'm twenty-five
i 'm not married
yeah
i just uh ha- have s- mm r- recently gone into like my first serious relationship in like two and half years
it 's very different though
and it 's funny that this is my topic tonight because i was just talking to my boyfriend last night about how i went into this relationship
at like my first love was at nineteen
i was with him for like almost four years
and how when i went into that relationship i kind of like i was n't looking so much for that what you want in a life partner
and now that 's a lot more important to me
this is the this is three months now
it 's gone really fast
like eh eh eh i i 'm surprised at how i mean we 've known each other for a long time
but once we kind of got together like we just connected off
like so we 're in that like oh you 're so wonderful phase you know the one that only lasts for like a little while
and then you know pretty soon i 'm like get the hell out of here
you know
yeah
wow
yeah
yeah
wow
e-
see
i what honestly what i l- i mean my since i was young i 've always felt that the most important thing for me to find in someone that i would spend my life with was the same bottom line
and to me that 's faith in god
and and that 's really i mean for me that 's r- r- really what 's most important because i feel like no matter what you face in life if you can come back to that then you can really face anything
really
yeah
yeah
did you guys have different belief systems when you were first together
or you just like were n't
yeah
really
background
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
my sister 's married to a guy who i mean he 's pretty much he 's a non he 's definitively a non-believer
and she is a believer
and i mean uh somehow works with them you know b- i think because he does n't he 's not like anti
you know like he wou- he you know we my niece was baptized
and ultimately he 's supportive of my sister eh sister 's belief
and i guess maybe it 's it 's a it 's maybe maybe it 's more about respecting each other 's beliefs
hello
oh okay
um basically i think um my um outlook on people in the situation has changed a lot um since september eleventh
i 've been um much more um easygoing and kind of let things slide
things that used to bother me i just um kind of ignore now
so you know um little things
you know
mhm
mhm
r- right
mhm
hm
okay
right
mhm
um uh basically um and when we do travel it seems to be closer to home
mm you know and um i think eh one thing that has um become of this
i was raised in an era with uh grandparents great grandparents
and well my daughter was f- almost fifteen or sixteen d- um w- d- before her great great grandmother passed away
so family was always very close
and then all of a sudden um we all got spread out
you know i have sisters and brothers in new hampshire
my parents are in new york
i 'm in florida
and um it just became very unusual because of having as a kid all of the family
you know my t- father was um his m- mother was one of ten
uh and everybody lived within a fifty mile radius
and n- now all of a sudden everybody 's spread out
and that 's not fun anymore
and him you know considered you know quote moving back north again to to be closer to family
you know and even you know kind of splitting the difference between where my brother and sister are and my parents are just to
it 's the way it 's supposed to be
if you know what i mean so it 's just you know
mhm
right
mhm
right
right
mm
mhm
right
mhm
right
mhm
yeah
mhm
right
mhm
right
mm
mhm
right
mm
right
mm
mhm
yeah
okay
mhm
mm right
mhm
right
mhm
right
mhm
mm right
mm right
mm
mm
mm
hello
mhm
oh no
i 'm kind of the i 'm the like the same way
uh you know uh eh eh s- eh especially like with family
you know family problems and stuff
uh you know eh i i seem to more or less g- gravitate towards you know keeping my family together
and not you know i i listen to a lot of the news
and you know i try to keep updated and everything about what 's going on
but uh at the same time i 'm trying to like put it in the background and take care of and focus on you know what is more important my grandchildren and my children
and uh you know uh do n't travel at all
not anymore anyways
that 's the only thing that affected me
you know what about you
mhm
mhm
right
mhm
mhm
i know
i have um m- my daughter i have a daughter up in caribou maine uh which is a good ten hours away
i mean she could n't be i mean she might as well be in florida
uh i sh- i think she 'd be closer
and you know it 's like forty sixty below zero up there i- in the winter
and um you know i find i c- i ca n't go up and visit her
um and she does n't have any transportation
and you know putting her and eh you know on a plane eh you know nowadays i i w- i wo n't do it
and you know it has nothing to do with money
it has to do with safety concerns because you know you never know what 's going to happen
and so i find you know i have the same
my my relatives are basically all in this area
but we 're a very small family
um but it 's basically you know i have a daughter in hartford connecticut
um tho- you know it 's only four or five hours away
so um they 're not that far away
but they 're far enough you know that you know keeps the family all separated
and i wish everybody was closer because you never know like if something is going to happen you know like nine eleven that i mean i just sat there
eh you know my sister had called me
she lives a couple blocks away
and when that happened she had called me and said donna put on the put on the t. v.
you k- wo n't believe what 's happening
so i turned on the t. v.
and i was just sat there you know like what did i just see
you know and then i called my husband
you know eh eh wayne you got to come in here
and he came in
and that 's when the second plane had hit
and we just sat there in shock
but he had to go to work
and i felt like so terrified that day like you know oh there 's another plane missing
and i live right at logan airport
and i mean right in logan airport
i am on the outskirts of it
as a matter of fact there 's a hotel directly across the street that was just built
so whenever i heard you know the planes are being taken out of logan you know they were high-jacked out of logan i 'm like i live at logan
so i had a lot of fear
and you know still to this day
you know w- we found out you know like eh uh the terrorists were you know working for a taxi company that you know just happens to run through here all the time
so i find myself like looking at them all the time
and you know there is a fear factor of living so close to the airport
um you know the planes going overhead and stuff
i cringe
i mean you know uh not a v- not a very good feeling
but what do eh uh have you tried to like eh i know a lot of people have been um
yeah
i i agree in the sense that that mo- the heightened security just makes it harder
and they have to think of more devious ways of getting through
uh i flew um last month
f- uh i i went through the whole system
and i we- flew from uh las vegas to um the east coast
and i went through the security
and uh i find that they 're doing a lot better job than they did e- actually even a year ago because uh a year ago there were people that would look at my ticket and or pretend to look at it
and then just let you go on
this this time uh when the federal people took over i- it was a lot more serious
and then
mhm
well you can get inside the airport
uh you just ca n't get through security eh uh s- uh the security area
mm no
no
especially in in s- some of the big places
like here in order to get to the terminals you have to take a uh tram
but you have to go securit- through security before you can even get to the tram
mhm
you know well they have n't up until now they have n't been searching the suitcases that have been going into the uh uh planes
and so s- s- search not searching the suitcases anybody could put anything into a suitcase and then and then n- n- take it o- uh blow it up from remote control
so it 's
yeah
yeah
b- now there 's a there 's a very complicated and uh sniffing and and all kinds of this big very expensive machine that every suitcase goes through
and even then if there 's s- if there 's something that they 're not sure of now they ha- they tell you you ca n't even lock your suitcases c- because uh they want to be able to open them without you watching them i think
yeah
mhm
right
but they did n't even have the machines that would do it
and so a lot of the suitcases just went into the plane
and that was it
uh this is eh eh the uh mccarran airport
where in las vegas
it 's a very huge airport
eh eh yeah
because all the tourists come through here
and um but every airport the what they 've done in the last year is they 've bought made the federal government has bought these big expensive uh machines that 's supposed to detect eh explosives
and every suitcase is supposed to go through it
and that 's in all the airports now that they were putting them in
they 're much better than whatever they were using
and so that uh now it 's supposed to stop that
but you never know
mhm
yep
right
wave you through
right
right
yeah
um
hm
yeah
i have n't i have n't been on a uh a plane in probably about a year
so i did n't actually um witness it
but one of the things that i did want to do was uh uh with my girlfriend over the summer uh we wanted to go to uh the airport just to sit there and watch people you know because it 's a interesting place
and uh i talked to someone that i was working with
and they said no
you ca n't even like they wo n't even let you in the door without a ticket
you know and uh so that 's
mhm
right
so n-
not even close to where the terminals are
yeah
so tha-
yeah
um at o'hare there was uh they just have uh every the there 's a uh at the terminal entrance place you have to go like down uh a big escalator and then across to like the opposite end of the airport
um and they do and they do i think they have the security checks at before you go on the escalator thing and then after
um kind of redundant
but um i do n't know
uh so my final answer with the thing i i-
yeah
i w- definitely i would say that it it would uh you know the the more money you throw at at a cause you know it does have some effect
you know
right
right
they still they still s- uh send them through uh x. ray machines there though right
they want to o- without your uh your kind of uh i- because before yeah
before they would a- they would ask
and they 'd make you do it
you know but from what you 're saying it 's probably the opposite
oh
we oh
yeah
we always had we always had the v- uh long x. ray machines um at o'hare
but that 's i do n't know
ha- how is like airport size
what is uh the one by you
is is comparable to
oh
yeah
i 'd imagine
right
hm
oh okay
hm
uh w- my best friend 's uh mom just got a job at o'hare as one of the uh like scanners
for the the they sit at the x. ray machine and uh watch
and she you know she went through like i do n't know it wa- it was like a month worth of training
um but still knowing knowing her she like uh you know just because she 's you know kind of older she 's not computer literate
you know and uh you know so my friend was telling me you know like my mom looking for bombs
you know like she 's not going to know a bomb from a hole in the wall
you know so uh so i do n't know
so i think that 's a major i think that should be taken into account too that um you know although it appears that you have the manpower that does n't necessarily mean that that that actually you know stops anything
that 's for sure
why more has to be be put into it
you know at least at least they 're aware of the problem can happen i guess
not i do n't think firstly that you and i can do anything about it
it would n't do us any good to sit back here and worry about it
right
yeah
i agree with that completely
i agree with that
you ca n't put
the it 's very scary
but you ca n't be like an ostrich and stick your head in the sand either
mhm
my grandfather i-
yeah
my grandfather was gassed in world war two so uh world war one i 'm sorry
so so
yeah
i know exactly what you 're talking about there
he suffered from it all his life
yeah
i do too
i feel the same way
and i i 'm glad
kentucky
where are you
oh
wow
you 're down there where it 's warmer anyway
yeah
right
i 've heard of that
yeah
so they going to tell us when to shut up on here
or we just we
we decide this we
oh
the i
okay
um not really
you know it 's one of those things i i do n't think th- like i say i do n't think we can whol- do a whole lot about it
i feel like our government 's doing what they can about it
eh so uh
why depress everybody on the subject
i said why depress everybody trying to talk about the subject
mhm
that was an experience
oh it be a wonderful experience
all appreciate more what they have
yeah
well they 're kind of like that in kentucky though
yeah
everything they 're doing i think they 're they 're doing out of necessity
uh yeah
he 's
yeah
mhm
no
no
the only thing if you 're really that uh concerned about it to that point uh that 's what our representatives are for
to uh that 's really the only thing
and eh th- then my my feeling too is eh you know i i appreciate and respect different viewpoints on it
but uh i still think uh there there are some people who are you know uh not facing the way things are
and eh i think uh to uh hold a descending opinion 's one thing
but i think eh y- you can actually go to the uh holding us back from doing what we have to too
you know
y- you understa-
yeah
it 's a sensitive subject
but holy cow it 's a scary time
r- right
my i 'm old enough to remember um well a lot of things my parents told me about world war one and two
you know so
you know i also am very st- uh i believe that uh if uh uh eh if you rep- i 'm trying to hurry here uh do n't repeat history
you know
yeah
i do n't understand how people ca n't look at this and just say i mean eh how they some people like i said a descending op- opinion but how they can say some of the things they say
you know
i mean it 's eh it 's like no one wants this
no one wants to do this
but uh it it i think last night he was very candid
uh he was very i think he really hit the nail on the head
as to and it t- to me it looked very genuine and sincere in what he and the the others were saying
uh like i i do n't know
i see him as being responsible myself
uh what state are you calling from
oh
okay
are you i 'm in uh i 'm in florida
i moved here from uh california a few months ago
and
oh
do n't well s- mm uh not much
it 's finally starting with a warm up today and this week
but it 's been down eh you know like say in the low thirties
uh so
yeah
i used to talk to a lot of people from kentucky when i w- i worked for a company called volaris
uh they got bought out by earthlink
uh i 'd uh certainly like to go back there for the history
i like the history
so
i do n't know
my girlfriend did this one time
and she 's been aching to have me uh do this
so
hm
oh they want to record your speech patterns
i see
but
yeah
do w- what about your friends
do most of your friends feel the same way
have you talked to other people about it
mhm
yeah
mhm
mhm
well i certainly feel the same way
uh
what 's that
well there 's a lot of people who 're s- whose kids are going too
uh i know when i was in it was like i just missed the vietnam era by like two or three months uh as far as being a a vietnam veteran
and and back then it was uh we had it pretty easy
they called it uh uh after nam it was like take it easy
you know uh eh they called it a an inspection navy
but still at the same time i was able to go overseas and and see things the way the way other people live
you know and uh
yeah
it really was
and uh some other people that i 've talked to recently even agree that i- i- it 's too bad
it would um they wo n't do it i 'm sure
but every kid out of high school ought to spend two years overseas and see what it 's really really like
it r-
it really would
that and you know i- if uh there 's always the ugly american the good american the ugly th- uh greek or the good greek
if you were the the good american you did n't uh pop off and you respected them and tried to learn their language they would sit you in especially up north
they would take you in and uh sit you down and have dinner and everything
they 're just wonderful people
but it 's uh
yeah
oh
i 'll bet
you know i keep hearing about this southern hospitality
you know
so i 'd love to go to kentucky and and tennessee and see that part of the world
i 've i 've seen a few states but not that part
you know i think
well i my kids are all grown and gone
and that
yeah
that puts a different light on it
does n't it
i would
a- although i do n't think i would panic
i do n't think i would
yeah
well there 's that 's the difference is having you know having yo- young kids at home
i guess it 's you know one of the really important things is probably just to not to dwell on it but to to d- decide i- in your mind you know what what would i do if such and such happened
i guess i 've thought about it a little bit you know just watching things on t. v.
where do you live
oh you do
are yo- do you live in a like in a city
so how big is your town
okay
right
maybe that 's a better reason not to panic
eh well if you do n't know so much about what 's going sometimes people in a in a rural setting think calmer
you know
oh
yeah
yeah
well good for you
i think en- environment makes a huge difference
yeah
is n't that sad
you know
oh
it 's not scary
yeah
i guess that is a kind of terrorism you know when we worry about those things
w-
yeah
you know i guess it depends on what you know i mean terrorism there 's so many definitions of it
you know we i live in in montana
and we live about three miles from a small town
i think the population is about nine hundred
so it 's pretty rural
but we live about thirty-five miles from great falls
and there 's an air force base there
and we have missile sites all over
i mean there 're missile sites just miles from where we live
and we just
well you know i think a lot of um not being scared is is thinking about things that you know i mean th- that death is n't really the end
and you know i just think that people would really pull together
um i can see a terrorist attack on the air base or on like the missile sites around here
um
you know so it 's a kind of a target
um
and i could
right
sounds sounds about like like here though
and i think that maybe um a lot of it depends on how how prepared we are
if we had a a terrorist attack here and maybe the the the truck lines were shut down and we could n't get food to the grocery stores we um we 've got a basement f- f- full of food
right
well except even if it was to go to the bigger cities yo- it would take twenty-four hours for your small little town to be cleared the grocery stores to be cleared of food
you know
you know so
well you know i think that 's one of things that would keep us from being um you know p- eh p- panicking
it 's to know
well we you know we 're prepared in that way
we 've got food and water stored
um and i think another way p- to prepare is just to be calm in your own mind about things
you know
well no
but there ha- i'v- i 've know people who 've who 've used their food storage because they 've had you know been out of work or because the b- bread winners had an accident or had to be in the hospital for a while
um you know just when times are are hard like that
so
do you know what you would do
oh
see and mine are eleven and fourteen stil-
yeah
no
oh god i think i would
i panic when my kids get hurt
right
right
right
well i i never really sat and thought about what i would do
i live in wisconsin
yeah
no
i live in a little small town out of la crosse
there 's four thousand people
so if anything happened here i think everybody would panic
it 's not a real up to date technology wise town
why 's that
mhm
yeah
maybe
maybe
but my originally i 'm from chicago
so i do n't think calm about anything
i always pretty much look at you know some of the stuff that i 've seen growing up in chicago
and that 's almost like living with terrorism right there
you know and i had to get out of there
i got my kids out of there and give my kids half a chance to not grow up like that
oh god
yeah
you know if my kids were still in chicago god they 'd be on drugs
these kids are selling drugs in third grade out there
that is awful
it 's just horrid
and i try
i got a fourteen year old
and every day the the biggest thing on my mind is is she going to come home pregnant or on drugs
you know and it 's eh well
yeah
yeah
it is
yup
but if we ever had any real terrorism i do n't know
i 'd probably get my kids
and i do n't know what i 'd do
i would panic
what kind of way would they come in
uh-huh
uh-huh
wow
that is a small town
wow
you got to be scared about stuff like that
right
mhm
i have a base not far from too fort mccoy
mhm
i got the same thing here
it 's only like forty minutes from here though
you 're a lot closer
wow
that 's a good idea
i never thought abou- well i did think about it
but you know what like i says i 'm insi- i 'm a sma- in a small town
and if anything were to happen it 's going to go to the bigger cities before me
oh yeah
it w- would n't even take that much because our grocery store 's so little
god
it it only takes a saturday by us
so you are well prepared then
yeah
i guess
did you ever eh did you do you ever think you 'd ever have to use that stuff down there
excuse me
mhm
yeah
that 's true too
let 's see how do we draw the line
i think there 's the wince factor
wince
you know if you hear something and you go oh no
oh
uh-huh
mhm
mhm
right
eh although let 's suppose you 're watching the jay leno monologue which i often watch in order to fall asleep
and uh i know when he 's crossed the line
i mean he 's done some some o. j. and clinton jokes where i think it 's gone not just into the r. rated area but just mean
that you know kind of it 's m- in bad taste because it 's it 's just mean
yes
but you see the problem with those is it 's hard to say if they 're in bad taste because the bad taste is in the mind of the viewer so to speak
now is he showing us a headline that they probably meant in all sincerity or an article about a a a crime or something
uh and it 's up to us to judge whether it 's you know uh funny or not
yes
because most of them are not intentional
the selection of them is intentional
they 're they 're already suggesting there 's something humorous when they present it
but some of them uh are just
well
when he 's presenting the two last names of people that got married he 's not saying is anything dirty or filthy or funny about their names except by suggestion
mhm
yes
well that 's true
i think the lines uh in terms of what 's in good taste um changes over time because uh there are some things that my kids think are really funny that i think are just trash
mhm
i hope they 're uh young enough that they have n't started listening to adam sandler 's tapes
okay
because i um one of my kids had one
y- this is a number of years ago because they 're out of the house now
and i said i do n't want to ever hear that in the house again
mhm
oh
sure
right
and not only that
but eh this is n't just humor but language
um
i
oh really
oh
yes
you know that 's
right
but if you can either screen out or ignore the bad language that 's a good example of humor that even when it pushes the line they tend to be really funny
because i think i think i- here here 's an e- uh an interesting point
maybe sometimes things are funny because there 's so much creativity involved
because they 're so imaginative when they can improvise these uh little scenes that they do or the songs
or when the- when they write songs on the fly they 're really funny
and i think it 's because the you ca n't imagine that someone can make that up
the what factor
oh
m-
yes
i just had that happen the other night
um i had read something
i guess there was one of those roasts where they roast somebody
and there was something in bad humor
i wo n't even mention it
i just oh i could n't believe it
but um i watch a lot of t. v. at night
not a lot
but um i like more humorous stuff
but there 's some things that you just kind of have to turn the channel
it just gets
like you said y- when you wince it 's time to turn the channel
yep
mhm
mhm
yes
i w- i fall asleep to that too
and i i like the um oh when he does the headlines
and those are humorous
but there 's a few of them i- even he does n't say out loud that you have to read
and poor taste
poor taste
yes
yeah
whether it was a mistake or intentional
mhm
uh
yes
yes
and sometimes i think if we watch it too much we come to accept it and do n't react quite as much
a- and i think the line gets moved a little bit further and further away
ach
oh
i n- i have five children
i understand
when they come home and tell me something
o- one of my sons just came home and did something and thought it was very funny
and i said you know that 's inappropriate
y- we that 's we draw the line before that and explain
we no
we do n't allow those in our home
no
no
that 's
yeah
and they get used to hearing that
and then they do n't know where to draw the line
um
they just
i 'm trying to think of my kids coming home with things that they 've said
and i thought oh no
no
no
no
no
no
bad humor
bad humor
yes
we have w- um something on our t. v. that cuts that out
so
yes
so that that 's really good
and we can watch shows
um i like um whose line is it anyway
i just bust up
but some of the things are a little inappropriate
and it just blocks it out
and you can still laugh at it w- without the bad language
or
yes
yes
yes
mhm
yes
um i do n't think i would take the million dollars just because my family is in the states
and i would n't want to stay somewhere foreign for the rest of my life
so
but
you would n't either
no
oh yeah
exactly
that 's
yeah
i would definitely take it if i could c- come back
but if we were n't eh s- a- allowed to come back then probably not
uh-huh
yeah
eh what about the language barrier
is that hard to get over
oh okay
yeah
yeah
what would you um w- what would you miss if you left
yeah
mhm
right
yeah
freedom of religion and speech and stuff like that i 'd definitely miss
yeah
yeah
what would you not miss
yeah
yeah
oh definitely
uh-huh
yeah
maybe the diversity
but i think a lot of things like that i would n't miss like hypocrisy things like that would be prevalent elsewhere
so
just um you know like politics and how eh different systems work things like that
you know the corporate world
you know lawyers stuff like that
eh w- just i mean but there 's dishonesty everywhere
so i mean i i i think the u. s. would be the best place to live anywhere than anywhere
so
right
mhm
yeah
it is definitely the best government
definitely
right
mhm
mhm
yeah
yeah
i like having the role left up to the people the citizens rather than the next in line
so
mhm
mhm
mhm
yeah
definitely
yeah
mhm
or they tell you what to study and what to go into
or you know you have to make that choice at a young age
and then you 're stuck with it for the rest of your life
which does n't sound very pleasant to me
oh wow
see eh who knows at that age
well well i love the states
it 's probably the best
i would n't like
well
i 'm actually from texas
so kind of mm the south a little bit
mhm
yeah
i wou- i would n't
i 'd i probably would n't either if
uh well unless uh i lived in italy for a long time
so eh i i i might take it and go live in italy
but only with the eh stipulation that i could return every once in a while
uh-huh
uh-huh
it 's hard to live in another country though
it 's completely different different culture
and so i that would be one thing that kept me home
well i-
well if i i speak italian
so it 's uh so it 's that would n't be as hard
so
so
i would uh i i 'd miss the f- well i was going to say i 'd miss the food
but italian food is really good
and i love italian food
so but i would i would miss the uh th- some of the patriotism
i 'd miss um al- you know all my friends here but uh just the freedom tha- th- that 's here
yeah
they have that they have that too in italy
but uh it 's not quite the same
but
um i do n't think there 's anything i would n't miss
i 'd well
eh there are n't very many fast food restaurants in italy
and i 'm not a fast food person
so i do n't i do n't l- i do n't like fast food
so i w- i would n't miss that
um what i would definitely miss for sure is the uh medical care here in the u. s.
so
yeah
mhm
e- explain what you mean by hypocrisy
uh-huh
yeah
mhm
yeah
yeah
it is
i think they have the it 's the it 's the best government that exists even though it 's no- it 's not perfect
and there is there is a lot of hypocrisy
but
uh but i
it 's eh it 's nice to have uh new leadership every four years
or you know at least a an election every four years
and with the uh understanding that he wo n't have more than eight years in office
there a lot of countries tha- that uh either have dictators or you know yo- eh leaders that are there for life
i i would n't like that
yeah
it 'd be nice
eh one thing i would i do n't know
i 'm probably changing the subject
um but one thing i would like is uh to have a direct say instead of just an an elected person who speaks for me
i would like to have a direct say in things
and i do n't i 'm not sure of a of a country that has exactly that
but um but anyway
so i do n't i do n't think there 's anything else that i would i i would miss
eh uh a- also one thing that i would definitely miss is the fact that anybody anybody in the country can get a college education now
um eh i- ther- most countries really if you have the money you can get an education
if not there 's not a- as much government assistance as there is here
uh-huh
yeah
that 's the way it is in italy
they have to choose by middle age my by uh middle school age
to uh
yeah
yeah
almost fifty
yep
are you from the east of from the west
or
oh
okay
so that 's a nice part of the country
i 've actually i 've never i 've uh never been down there
but eh i have lots of friends that are from there
what kind of business would you open
yeah
that 's really cool
how would you um how would you go about opening it if money 's not an issue
yeah
yeah
yeah
definitely
uh-huh
yeah
definitely
mhm
yeah
um mine i think i w- i 'd would pick a couple of different things
eh i would either open up my own daycare center or like in advertising because i like i like working with like children
so like maybe like in advertising like baby clothes like a baby clothes line or like opening a daycare center
but and i would have to go and um take a you know courses on how to you know everything about the daycare center and take the classes and you know just learn you know everything there is about it
yeah
and um like a lot of people that i know like at w- you know work and everything they will they 've told me you know how they want their children to go to daycare
and they say it 's so hard to try to find a place you know to put their kids in daycare because there 's like waiting lists like l- long waiting lists because people are picky about who they take
you know i would have to consider all the options about what kind of children i would you know allow in my daycare center because you have to be cautious about things like uh you know lice and you know sit- you know germs
and you n- you never know
you know and uh like they 'd definitely have to be potty trained
you know you have to think about those kind of things and just like the regulations
and um like i 'd like you said i would have to advertise you know for my business
and um
yeah
mhm
yeah
um there 's just so many things you know because you ca n't like with the small children you know they 're going to have to be potty trained
and they 're going to have to you know meet certain requirements
and
yeah
yeah
yeah
there 's i mean
i do n't know
it depends on how many kids i guess you 're going to have
i mean if you 're not going to g-
i w- i myself i think i would be picky about it
i w- would want them to be
i mean if you 're just going to have you know small daycare center i guess if you if you really wanted to you know i guess they really would n't have to
but there 's just maybe you could get more business that way
i w- i mean i do n't know
but it just it seems like it 'd be a lot more easier to you know have some sort of standards you know like certain things like that
yeah
mhm
mhm
yeah
uh-huh
mhm
yeah
mhm
yeah
definitely
i mean it would have to be for uh d- number of rooms
and
mhm
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
mhm
yeah
yeah
mhm
oh
yeah
jeez
i do n't know
i 'm really into computers
and i 'd really like to have like a p. c. repair shop
mm well eh
yeah
they w- it would definitely not have to be an issue because things are so expensive where we live um you know like p- places to rent for a business or whatever
um well the first thing i would do is eh i 'm in the process of i 'm i 'm strongly considering taking a p- p. c. repair course
and so i guess you know the other thing would be location location location and eh you know advertising
um but if money was no i- was not a problem that would n't you know all that would just fall together
oh yeah
uh-huh
oh get your certifications and all that
yeah
mhm
mhm
and then you have the state regulations
yeah
which are i do n't know about there but here they 're pretty stringent
yeah
well most of the places around here i think they do n't e- they do n't take them until they 're e- either potty trained
or um well i do n't know
the uh some of the commercial daycares will take them like at six months
but then most of the at home ones they want them potty trained
yeah
yeah
and and the clientele you have to be kind of picky about them too
you know scree- because i i know eh i used to work for a law firm
and um most all the girls had their children in the same daycare
and they said you know some of the mothers are really wacky
but you know they took like they had oh th- like they had one room for like six months to nine mon- well i eh it was n't that old it was like less than that it was like infants
and when they got to sit up they would move to another room
and there were like four or five babies
and then as they got older when they went through these different stages they 'd move to a different classroom
and they went all the way up i think to about six years old
so that was a pretty big place
and but it was very expensive
yeah
i mean
yeah
and then they had you know da- a couple of teachers or or daycare attendants or whatnot in in each one and um a big common play area
and then of course they had age appropriate stuff in each little room
um but the parents i think they had to sen- provide the uh the snacks
um but then the the the daycare providers had to you know like feed them
um which was kind of neat
they had this thing cut up
w- uh it was like a a half eh like a doughnut type of um um bench with a little table in front of it that had little holes in it where you could like put bowls in front of it
huh
oh really
wow
well being in the linguistics department um
yeah
i 've been interested in opening up a school eh to teach english second language
uh and i actually have looked into that before
but i do n't have enough money because eh where i 'm from there 's a lot of um mexicans
and they go to temp agencies to find jobs
and so i went and talked to the temp agency
and i was like hey um i 'm going to teach your employees english
and you give me the referrals
and then we 'll like you know you pay me and money to do this
and so go through them
you know
and he was like yeah
come back when you um are able to pay for that
because i was like it 's just an idea
but what do you think
and he 's like yeah
so but that was like eh three years ago
but anyway that 's my little idea
um okay
that depends on where you have it though
yeah
me either
like it definitely would n't work in provo
you 'd have to go like
yeah
somewhere else
like lincoln city oregon
that 's a good place
yeah
yeah
if you go along the coast you 'll find good places over there
but
um i think my business would be successful because it 's a d- like there 's tons of people who have to learn english that are always looking to learn
especially people like that that are working at temp agencies which are a lot of them
so
yeah
um what else are we supposed to talk about
oh really
when did we start eh talking
um okay
um it 's not a very good topic
uh i know
i 'm a student
what are you studying
oh
you are
are you in linguistics minor
or
okay
okay
oh really
when
oh
that 's really cool
do you speak japanese at all
well that 's probably good though
that 's probably good because i- like if you eh sometimes if you speak a language then they use it as a crutch
and then they know
so was it in a
eh oh go ahead
yeah
do you speak any languages right now
oh you do
oh i studied french a long t- f- time ago
well it was n't that long ago
um it was my major
and then i forgot french because i went to italy
though
yeah
yeah
but i lost a lot of it
did you go on a mission to france
or
oh really
my cousin went there
when did you get back
oh when did he get back
his last name is strausser elder strausser
oh
you do
yes
that 's my crazy cousin
oh good because sometimes i 'm scared to tell people it 's my cousin
and i 'm like oh
yeah
joel 's my cousin
yeah
he lives with my brother right now at rick 's
yeah
oh b. y. u. idaho whatever it 's called
but
so english huh
h-
yeah
my friend here says i probably would n't even open my own business
and i think she 's right actually
but i th- i think maybe like a bed and breakfast would be a neat business to run
yeah
what about you
uh-huh
oh cool
uh-huh
yeah
it 's eh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
that 's cool
that 's cool
yeah
that 's that 's interesting
yeah
i guess you 're supposed to talk about whether we 'd be successful or not
i do n't eh i do n't know if i would to be honest
yeah
yeah
yeah
i guess with the bed and breakfast idea i i i guess it could be
i just i 'm not a big risk taker
i 'm not into spending money beyond what i have
yeah
yeah
oh yeah
somewhere where there 's a nice charming setting
yeah
is that on the coast
that 's cool
yeah
sure it 's gorgeous
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i 'm
yeah
just i mean there 's a niche for it
that 's cool
it 's interesting
uh-huh i do n't know
it 's supposed to go on for ten minutes
i know that much
yeah
and i do n't know if it just shuts off
i do n't eh um i was n't clear on that part
that 's a good question
maybe about five minutes ago
beats me
yeah
i know
we 're hardly business people
about it
yeah
i 'm an english major
mhm
yeah
uh i 'm not
it 's my friend who signed me up
and
yeah
i 'm going to teach english in japan
yeah
yeah
graduate in april
yeah
i 'm going august july
no
i do n't
that 's the trick
but what 's that
yeah
oh yeah
yeah
that 's true
yeah
i i
oh
i want to learn
eh you know i mean i want to pick it up
but we 'll see
i speak french
uh-huh
mhm
yeah
oh
really
that 's cool
uh-huh
you go on a mission
that 's cool
huh
yeah
i did
i went to eh brussels actually
france too
but
yeah
really
i got back in two thousand august two thousand
oh
yeah
i know elder strausser
joel strausser is n't it
yeah
yeah
he 's a funny guy
i liked him a lot
no
he was cool
i liked him
he was fun
easy going
oh that 's cool
yeah
whatever
that 's cool
hm
i wonder
yeah
at one time i thought i was going to be i was going to go into business
like i thought i was going to get an m. b. a.
what about for a travel standpoint
right
well other countries require i mean english is now the language of business
but other countries require their people their students their children to learn english
and the um other countries you know they know english
when
right
and you do n't uh we as americans or english speaking people i have n't had any problems in my travels
although when i do travel to foreign countries i will uh bone up on their language you know enough to get by
but i kind of i would think that probably in spanish and also at this time it 's probably would be wise
for like i know when i was coming up in th- when i- educated in the fifties they did i- h- here in elementary school also always make reference to arabic
i think we need to return to them days because i think the influence is going to be uh returning now basically because of the economics right now particularly with this oil problem world wide
but in college i do think uh i would say that they do probably need to i go along with you would to encourage it
but um i guess you were right in re- in a regard to english is the big language to know
yeah
right
well they do intersect with you know um spanish speaking for ah we 're using examples spanish speaking people
like like today actually in uh one uh the things i was doing today
it 's not a requirement to know spanish because i 'm speaking only to spanish speaking people
but it 's an asset to me
right
mandatory
yeah
this is true
you do n't have enough room on your uh in your graduation requirements to but i do n't know
i 'm seeing more and more in the job market that they 're wanting people to be bilingual
yeah
i agree there too
i agree
yeah
but- i- in my travels it is an asset
that that well i mean i 'm noticing that every country i go to english is known by the school children
you know so from a communication standpoint you do not have now some people even will try to act like they do n't speak english
even in canada in french speak- in in quebec montreal specifically i know you know that they know how to speak english
but some will try to act like they do n't
and that 's from the earliest age
i mean the kids know english up there
they also know their french
but you know to get the higher paying jobs in um canada you have to know english
and i 'm finding throughout the coun- the i mean the world i was like i 've been in saudi arabia
and and i was in tunisia in africa
and everybody knows english
in france you know they know engli- th- might not want to speak it but they know
for travel
um well you know it 's good to know
i do n't think it should be a requirement though
uh-huh
yup
a lot of other countries people know english
yeah
uh-huh
mhm
yeah
yeah
it 's pretty much you know the uh become very established
uh many countries uh and a lot of uh you know um major universities do require uh a foreign language
um but there 's so you know like for example i mean say if you 're say if you 're going to college to be like uh i do n't know uh a a dental assistant or you know i really do n't see too much of a point of requiring that you have a foreign language
uh-huh
mhm
oh
it 's absolutely an asset
i mean i 've personally all right i think the more you know the better
and i i 'm all for learning languages
but is uh you know as far as it being a requirement per se i mean there 's other important things too
so i do n't
mhm
i think that they should give uh students a much broader like a a more world view of things
an- and that would i think get a lot of kids maybe uh you know actually interested in taking up some kind of foreign language
and it would give them more incentive of learning it
oh
it 's an asset
yeah
mhm
mhm
yo
right
mhm
yeah
mhm
yeah
yeah
i know what you mean
yeah
yeah
how long you been uh hooked up with th- uh program
yeah
yeah
i just started
ah let 's see i started tuesday
yeah
yeah
man i- i- i told some people about it
they did n't believe it though
they they think it- they think there 's a little catch to it or something
you know
yeah
everybody you know like these restaurants around here man where i live at man i do n't really do n't care for they food too much
you know
yeah
not too much
they got their own people in there cooking man
you think that tho- they ca n't cook that good
you know
uh-huh
yeah
say free food
there 's something wrong with sometime-
that 'd make you think there 's something wrong they give you free food at a restaurant
what restaurant is that
over there
yeah
i bet that restaurant was crowd-
but what how 'd the food taste
yeah
oh sometimes you know it just depends on who 's cooking
sometimes it 's good
sometimes it 's bad
huh
yeah
i guess that 's the same way it is down this way
you know most of the times most of the times the food do n't taste that good
you know it 's like you say it depends on who 's cooking
you know
yeah
i started to get into restaurant business one time man
well there 's so many restaurants arou- out here now
you know i do n't think i 'd be making that much money if i opened up a restaurant business
i probably be putting more money out put more money in it than i than i might get out of it
yeah
i remembered years ago man you got to walk like five or six blocks to get to a restaurant
n- n- now you only have to walk around the corner
yeah
yeah
it feel like it 's winter time out there now
see now
i 'm get ready to go out here in a few and buy me something to eat
oh though i might go to the chinese restaurant and buy something
mhm
yeah
i was out there already
i just came in
but i ai n't but i came in here because first i had to make this phone call
you know and uh i had to get me a jacket or a coat
it 's almost cold enough for a coat now
yeah
mhm
yeah
i do n't know
i p- i probably end up going to a chinese restaurant
that 's what i 'll probably do
yeah
they do n't cost that much there
yeah
i think the chinese restaurant is the cheapest restaurant out there d- do n't you
or do you
yeah
mhm
yep
yeah
i at i took some young lady to a chinese restaurant down wa- chinatown one time
you know and uh
you know you ever taste them pina coladas they make
the chinese people make pina coladas
they taste good do n't they
yeah
yeah
i bought me bought her and i one of them
you know after i got finished drinking it man it felt like i was high man
th- the- they must have spiced it or something
hey ken
you see she do n't t- really drink
you know
yeah
man eh she walking out she walk out that place staggering man
i ler-
uh-huh
oh yeah
iced tea
yeah
i remember when they first put that out
yeah
a lot of people was buying that
mhm
yeah
but see like wh- tha- that restaurant down chinatown uh china- you know they call it chinatown
think it was down there eighth and arch
somewhere down there
yup
it eats it up too
oh about a week
yeah
oh
i kno- i did n't believe it at first either
yeah
i was like what
um
oh yeah
uh you got to watch them
uh-huh
um i used to um work in this restaurant
and they could n't cook for nothing
they used to give us free food
and i could n't stand none of it
um i do n't know why they
yeah
yes
it was um turf club in um s- center city
mm when it was c- fully cooked it was pretty good
it depend on who cooking
yeah
uh yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh uh-huh
yeah
that 's probably
yup
you sure did
yep
ever- everywhere now
yeah
i know
sure do
myself that 's what i was thinking about going
some chinese food
yeah
uh it 's that col-
i know
man i 'm have to get another coat
yeah
no
they about the f- few restaurants out there that do n't that not that high the chinese restaurants
yeah
they are
oh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
they are
they 're real good
uh-huh
yeah
that 's how they have you
yeah
oh
uh-huh
aw that 's what happened to me the first time i heard about long island iced teas
so i was wondering what it was
i drunk
woo-hoo
it 's pretty sweet
so i drunk about two more
and i went to get up and hit the ground
ye- yeah
yeah
i know
yeah
how do you like uh living there
do you
d- uh you 're calling me
i i 'm in brigantine new jersey
oh really
what area
oh okay
i 'm mm i 'm like up little bit more on the west end
but it it 's it 's nice
it 's uh very it 's nice now because no one 's like really here
it 's great
it 's
oh
it 's not there anymore
i do n't think it is
the pitts-
bu-
oh
oh ok-
it 's called oh the pittsburgh
yeah
okay
that place there
okay
yeah
i i just was n't familiar
i thought maybe it had changed hands or names
so what kind of um work do you do now
oh
that 's neat
i used to do shows out of the mandell theater
you know like um yeah
like old like time shows like no business like show business different things
you know
uh lady

i drive a limousine part time
and i
oh

he 's out of business now
he 's been out of business for three years
i wa- no he works for all the casinos
i 'm a contractor
so
yeah
it 's like flexible
you know it 's it 's not that great as it used to be though
so and it just see-
yeah
and a-
really
mhm
mhm
oh yeah
they were ma- and the doormen were making so much money
you know an- and everybody everybody was making so much money
it 's just like no one has anymore money

oh that 's cool
yeah
and you never know
yeah
yeah
well i 'm i do n't know w- i do n't know what they pay professors these days
but
i do n't know what they pay professors these days
bu- but you know i 'm sure y- living out in uh university city it e- gets expensive
mhm
and it 's only for what eighteen days or something like that
so not
yeah
it 's not bad
and then the tenth call i get thirty dollars
that 's not so bad
so are you married are you married david

really
oh
that 's great
that mus-
you know and i 'm sure you get a discount there too like if you want to take other courses or something
yeah
that 's great
that 's great
so what 's your future ambitions
oh
poconos are nice
are n't they
you know they were going to build casinos up there
but they nev-
never worked out
i do n't know what happened
i guess the money is not there
well as far as i know trump is not paying a soul anybody any money
and he 's so close to bankruptcy
you know it 's like
you know i it you just makes you wonder like how you people get stay in business when they 're not getting paid
you know
well there was a pizza shop here
it opened up
and um they closed down already
yeah
andre 's
um not andre 's um
andre yeah
andre 's they have the great like rosemary pizza there
it 's
i like it a lot actually
yeah
no shit
we have a uh i have a uh um my parents have a house in brigantine
twenty-seventh street
okay
d- ah september is the awesome month in brigantine
it 's the be- i worked uh one summer like in between college and grad school i worked over in atlantic city
i tended bar at uh the pittsburgh
i think it is
there 's still the the the it 's right across the st- it 's right across the parking lot from the irish pub
and uh yeah
on tennessee avenue
eh now i 'm actually uh a uh professor at drexel university
really
okay
so what what do you do
for michaels
no
oh
he is
okay
oh okay
oh okay
that 's cool
yeah
right
well the mon-
yeah
the problem is that like the money in the casinos never like went up when everything else went up
like i remember like i 'm thirty-seven years old
and i remember when the casinos first opened
okay
i was like eighteen
there were people who were like eighteen in nineteen seventy-nine nineteen-eighty who jumped into the casinos and were making like fifty grand
right
exactly
i like it a lot
actually
yeah
ah ju- i 'm germanic languages
actually yeah
basically i teach i teach german
and i do some upper level stuff
i do some dutch and some danish
so like but anything that 's upper level
my ah my field of expertise is actually german what i was trained in
this uh study
uh yeah
just to like just to talk
you know it 's like i mean i have uh i have a cell phone
and you know i have like these unlimited minutes free nights and weekends
i 'm like well if i can turn that into two hundred dollars that will pay my bills for some time
pardon
yeah
yeah
i mean two hundre- i i look at it as this way
like if i can earn two hundred dollars and the checks like flow in that 's um
yeah
if i can make two hundred dollars in eighteen days for five minutes a day ten minutes a day eh you know that 's a worth
right
it 's no- not a bad
yeah
i am
none
we just g- i just got married last year
uh thanks
yeah
my wife 's a lot li- younger than me actually
well
yeah
it 's definitely cool for me
you know
yeah
i 'm uh i 'm
pardon
oh
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh
yeah
exa-
yeah
i can take classes
um
i do n't know
i actually want to get a house in the poconos
yeah
i know
yeah
ah yeah
that 's probably it 's probably not the draw
it does n't have the draw
it does n't have the name that atlantic city has
right
r- yeah
right
well if you 're in brigantine you open up a pizza shop then
it 's like the pizza wars down there
another one
uh andre 's is like the life blood
you know
yeah
huh
no
i ca n't hear you
yeah
yeah
well
well see i 've i- i- do n't uh see i 've uh see i have been in the company of people taking drugs before
right
and uh i do n't like the smell of that stuff
you know
it make me sick just to be around that smoke
you know
yeah
it make me sick
and some people just they do n't care where they at
they be d- on the buses or or you know uh in the movies in the bath
no one stop them taking that stuff
you know they do n't care who 's around them
yeah
i 'd- i 'd- i get a i get away from them
yeah
because they say sometimes you can get uh you know attached to it by being around
you know
yeah
once it get in your system you know then you might want to have it
yeah
yeah
ye-
wha-
mhm
yeah
sure they can
they got s- man they got they can do so much today man you 'd be surprised man
yeah
oh the phone number is uh oh wait a minute uh one eight hundred
yeah
uh five oh seven
uh one three one f- one five
uh-huh
yeah
mhm
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
mhm
what 's that
yeah
i live in philadelphia
mhm
what you just moved to philly
w-
oh yeah
where was i
some some some spots
you know but uh g- as far as drugs
far as drugs concerned you know it 's all over i believe
it 's hard to move in a neighborhood where where do n't nobody do n't mess with drugs
yeah
uh-huh
that would be a good topic though
yeah
yeah
i do n't know
i 'm not real wild about drug testing
but i do n't know
i can see like in certain industries where it is kind of a mandatory
like i do n't know
i feel c- more comfortable flying on a plane knowing they do that
eh and uh i do n't know like in transportation pretty much basically i feel more comfortable
yeah
yeah
m yeah
yeah
yeah
and they 'll still hit it up anyway
yeah
yeah
just secondhand exposure
yeah
yeah
i know with uh with my work like uh they test randomly
and i know that they can i did n't know that before they could like they can actually uh test for secondhand exposure
basically like if you 've been in the presence of somebody that 's been smoking it actually shows up
it 's like such a negligible amount like in your system that they deduce that it 's uh secondhand
they were explaining that to us
i was like wow
so you mean like if it does show up in our system and it 's that certain amount then it wo n't it shows up that it 's uh secondhand smoke
and they 're like yeah
i was like wow i did n't know that because i did n't know they could test for that much like for uh second hand amount
yeah
that 's the truth
ah man
what is the uh what is the phone number that you dial to dial the l. d. c. thing because i lost my my uh paper
one eight hundred
five oh seven
one three
one three one five
okay
cool
yeah
i do n't know
i 'm pretty for the most part though i 'm pretty much like in some industries i do n't really see like uh wha- like why they have it
like i used to work in retail management for a while
and they had a you know it was stated in our policy that they could test you randomly for drugs
and but it was sort of like uh like a thing that they held back in case they did n't you know in case they were n't satisfied with your performance
and they thought there was you know some way they could get rid of you
but they did n't have any other ways
so they 'd use that
so it was n't really random
you know what i mean like kind of just was irritating more than anything but uh because i- i 'd worked at staples for like three years and never saw anyone tested for drugs
and there were numerous occasions where there were if they would have had testing they probably would have lost a few employees
but that 's just from my experience
and i was just like man you know this this is kind of amazing to me
they have this policy in place
and they do n't they do n't intend to use it unless they want to get rid of a specific person
so that does n't really classify it as random
uh i do n't know
i think they need to come up with a more truly random system than what they 've got now
but for the most part though i 'm for it
it 's just a little weird because there 's so many industries where if you 've got somebody that 's that 's abusing a substance it it 'll affect you your personal safety directly
like i would n't want to get on a bus if i knew the driver was smoking
you know what i mean
so or get in a plane if you knew the pilot was a heroin addict or something like that
m- variables that you do n't need to deal with
i do n't know my
you live in the city
do you live in the city
that 's cool
yeah
i 've been living here for like a year now
it 's pretty cool
i like it
yeah
about a year ago
my brother lives down here
he was uh in the coast guard
so i- job opportunity came up and i moved down here
so it 's pretty cool though
i like it
yeah
there 's some
yeah
yeah
yeah
just got to find some place
it 's cool though
i like it
i mean everybody for the most part 's pretty friendly
and uh i do n't like driving in the city
but
what do you mean
yeah
but yeah
but my mom 's making too much or something
i know
what they told us though
but like according to my according to my mom she ca n't like give me any money or something
i do n't know
so she 's paying way too much bills and like the house and stuff like that
so
are you in are you done school
oh
that 's cool
so how did you pay for it
like where did they go
did they go to like a s- nice like
what kind of school did they go to
college
like universities or something
so did they ha- di- did they have to take loans and stuff
how did you pay for it
how much is it
like
oh
back then
but like now it 's like doubled or something
uh-huh
that 's cool
so what kind of a job do you do
like
oh
well what 's your job though
like did you make lot of money or you were just working
like what what 's your job
like do you
so what 's that like
oh
okay

you know like i do n't think that you know i- i thi- i- my feeling is is that you know the harder you make something to get the more interested people are in getting it
so i think like if they legalize it then people will be able to use it for medicinal purposes
and maybe kids wo n't be quite as interested in it as they would be knowing that it 's illegal
what do you think
yeah
why do you think that
right
no
no
it ca n't they always the- their big thing is that it leads they think that when people smoke it it 'll lead them to crack use and things like that
but i do n't i do n't know
i do n't see it
i- i- it 's supposed to be a good pain reliever for people who are suffering like who are in a lot of pain with like bone cancer and things like that
it 's supposed to alleviate some of their pain
yeah
i do n't i do n't see what the big deal is
they sa- uh they ah to me that 's the only thing
they talk about how if you smoke even cigarettes you know then it leads you to smoke marijuana
and then if you smoke marijuana it leads you to smoke all the other things or take u- illegal drugs
but i know a lot of people who smoke marijuana who never took other any other illegal drugs and did n't get hooked on anything
but who knows
so we 're
what
i was going to say so we 're both in agreement
yeah
that 's true
yeah
that 's true
it would probably bring down the price a lot if it was legalized
so the drug dealers would n't like it being legalized too much
right
oh really
airheads
it would chill everybody out a little too much
that 's interesting though because i would think it would have the reverse effect
i think it people would become less interested in it because you know they can so easily get it
whereas to me like teenagers like to do things that are illegal and hard to do and you know be rebellious
i think that the usage would be down
but maybe that 's one reason they looked into amsterdam and said forget it
that 's what they said
right
just a- i see i think about alcohol and how in over in europe you know kids can get alcohol without any problem
and they do n't have big alcoholism problems like we do here n- ag- except for maybe russia
but i know like my f- my husband 's family is from italy
and they were always allowed to drink wine and everything else
and you know like it 's not a big deal over there
where like you know with teenagers here you got to drink to be cool
so
who knows
where you where you from
oh
are you
oh yeah
that 'll be nice
where you at in jersey
oh okay
yeah
i do
i live in philly
i live in northeast philly
but i used to go to brigantine when i was a kid
no
no
no
it 's not
i like it because it is not overcrowded
like a lot of the places get so crowded in the summer
you know
you can go to brigantine
and you do n't have to worry about all the mobs
ah brigantine
i probably probably about eight years now
i usually go now i now i 'm married and have kids
i go to ocean city and wildwood because there 's more like you know kiddie stuff
yeah
i- per-
yeah
it is
do you surf or something
yeah
is that why you 're heading out to hawaii
you going out there with friends or something
no
oh really
i have a friend that i grew up with
she moved out to california when we were kids
but um she we- she went to ha- she 's a- a- i think she 's going back to hawaii now
she 's been studying there
she went to japan
and now i think she 's going back to hawaii again
she loves it there
is this your first time
oh yeah
really
you know that 's part of the united states
i sure everybody knows everybody is getting high
you might as well just legalize it then
so what made you do this surve- uh this study
oh
yeah
yup
legalize it
legalize
why not
i mean they they got booze legal
it 's no worse than that i do n't think
oh
of course
i 'm sh-
i do n't know
what does it do for medical purposes
oh
yeah
why not
legalize a hundred percent
yup
i eith-
oh
go ahead
i 'm sorry
yes
it 's so expensive too
that 's the only problem i got with it
yeah
but ah i 've had friends who went to amsterdam
and they say that you kno- you know about amsterdam and an- all its legalizations well they say that place is just like bunch of space cadets walking around
so it maybe it would have a bad effect on society if make them a bunch of uh
yeah
yeah
yeah
i never made it out there myself
but
probably never will either
hm
yup
you got it
i 'm from right now i 'm in new jersey
yeah
in a couple days i 'm aloha bound for
yeah
for for the whole winter
so i 'm pretty stoked
i 'm on brig- i 'm in brigantine
you know where that is
not a bad spot
mhm
when was the last time you were here
okay
yeah
board walk
board walk great
b- board walk is so great
yes
yeah
no
just a sole mission
yeah
to hawaii
no
i i 've been there
that place has got so much marijuana
it 's ridiculous
it 's like part of the culture over there
yup
oh well uh i worked for the company that that that does the research before
and m- m- actually my brother and he c- he ah offered this participation to me
that 's true
but i think the artist should censor himself
you know they there was a time when i was younger my mom was younger i mean the music they implied a lot of things
they never came right out and and said it
and it sounds terrible to hear a little kid singing back that thing up
they do n't even know what they 're talking about
you know
i have little nieces and and little nephews
and to hear and then singing his songs it it 's a little upsetting
because i 'm like they do n't even know what they 're talking about
you know
they 're innocent
and i think today 's society kids grow up a lot faster because of you know the the media and and w- and uh what 's allowed on t. v.
there 's certain things that was not on television when i was growing up
just you would never see what you see now
you would never see like people in bed
now
oh my
good
they 're showing two wo- eh w- two women in bed together
two men in bed together
it 's just it it 's like
yeah
we are
we are
and nothing shocks us
it 's just sad
it is
it does n't
it 's to shock someone you they would really have to be like off
i mean people are eating people now
you know
uh uh i 'm like o-
i was like okay
now i mean w- after that one what else can you say
you really ca n't
it 's just terrible
what school do you go to
oh okay
so is that how you got involved in the study
oh okay
oh okay
oh
that 's great
that 's great
supposed if cell phones better because i do n't know
something in that nature
improve uh cell phones cell phone technology
yeah
yeah
you do
you do
yes
i do
i have a samsung uh one thousand
okay
okay
mm
oh okay
right
right
it does
it does
it does
and that 's and that 's what i heard too
now oh my god we 're all going to be walking with brain cancer for these things
you know so
mhm
oh my god
it 's terrible
mm
right
right
no
it 's not
it 's not
it 's not being being reg- i actually got a cell phone because i i travel a lot
my work
so i needed it like if if if i get lost or break down
but it 's it 's i was in the mall today in king of prussia mall
and when a phone would ring everybody would look down at their phone
it was it was unbelievable
everyone was walking around with cell phones
it 's like oh i 'm in the mall now shopping
and it 's like god i could i never seen so many people in one place with so many cell phones
it 's crazy
i 'm like ach
and mine was like in my pocket
but it was n't like i 'm walking around the mall talking on it
and i 'm like my god
mhm
it is
i know
it 's
especially in today 's society
my god my car broke down
i tell you
uh last month it broke down like every day
and i had like no cell phone
i had my cell phone
but it was n't i did n't have it activated
and i was like oh my god
oh i 'm like i 'm getting it activated
i 'm getting it a-
terrible
it 's terrible when you 've broken down and you 're stranded and you 're like oh lord
i think um we 're really going to lose out on a lot of great artistic works if we censor ourselves or censor our artists
right
mhm
right
right
that 's true
mhm
yeah
yeah
right
mm
yeah
we 're totally desensitized as a society
no it 's true
like nothing shocks anymore
yeah
uh i go to penn
yes
um
yeah
i think uh i actually had a class with the person who 's doing this study at all which i did n't know before i signed up for it
but the letter came in the mail
and uh i was like wow
i know who that is
mhm
yeah
i do n't really know what the study 's about though
i guess cell phones and such
yeah
um uh do you have a cell phone
i guess you do need one to participate in this study
oh
i 've a nokia six in the six one eight hundred sixty-one hundred series which is a good phone
but it does n't have one of the antennas that uh that uh extend
so i think it 's really bad in terms of radiation and stuff
like i 'm not going to get this phone again
i heard the best is the startech because the antenna uh points away from your head
mhm
yeah
yeah
but like i hear all this contradicting material information about cell phones
so i have a friend who took a toxicology class who said uh cell phones are going to be like th- cigarettes of this generation like in terms of
yeah
in terms of the health damages it 'll do
but all the published information on on web sites and scholarly studies that have been done say otherwise that it actually has no effect
but i heard next year they 're going to c- uh come out with like some sort of a rating system that 'll be on the boxes of all the new cell phones
so that you know what level of radiation you 're getting
like i do n't think uh this industry in terms of health is being regulated at all
oh okay
yeah
yeah
no i think i do think the pros of cell phones outweigh the cons
like it 's it 's so convenient
i used to make fun of people with cell phones before i actually got one
but now i do n't think i could live without it
it 's my eh just a convenience
it 's so good
oh no
oh
even worse
yeah
yeah
it definitely is a must if you drive
i mean there 's crime
but nothing like real bad going on
that 's nothing that you can like notice going on in the streets and all
there 's always cops everywhere here in roxborough
it 's one thing all the kids are always complaining about
yeah
mhm
mm i do n't know
it seems pretty safe
i do n't really see anything else they could do
yeah
they 're always good
and they also bring the community together too
because i have lot of neighbors around here
i mean most of them i do n't even know their names really
you know so it 'd be nice if you know i 'd get to meet them better more
yeah
oh i do n't know
hello
okay
can you hear me
okay
yeah
it 's these cell phones
m- yeah
i do n't know if it breaks up if we lose the money or whatever
huh no
this is like my fourth conversation
yeah
hope i get a check soon
i know
oh so you have to do ten
and then they mail the check
oh
okay
so i 'm working towards number ten too
yeah
i know
pay th- use this money to pay the cell phone bill
you know
mhm
yeah
mhm
because i would feel safer if i knew one was organized here
yeah
i mean we still have the cops and all
so i do n't i do n't feel unsafe or anything
but you know but i know there 's like people watching out for everyone
then it 's you know just reassures you
mhm
yeah
yeah
mhm
huh
yeah
i know
the little vandalism
yeah
because that makes people feel bad about the community
graffiti and all
yeah
i know
and then when you look out your house and you see all the litter everywhere and the graffiti really lessens your view of the whole community and life an- and everything
i know
yeah
yeah
have more pride in it
and then you would n't
mhm
hm i do n't know
they do n't always give that good of topics
they 're really vague sometimes
i had one where it was what if you find a roach in your fiancee 's salad she made
yeah
i know
sala-
yup
i know
yup
call the exterminator too
yep
no
i 've only been doing this for m- i think a week now
should probably go check the mail today
might have came already
ah yeah
mhm
no
i do n't think so
yeah
uh-huh
i see
always
oh
so there 's a lot of police presence
and that cuts down on crime
and ah do you think they could do anything else to help cut down on crime
they
uh-huh
how about a town watch
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
hello
you 're starting to break up
what happened
hello
yeah
yeah
i can hear you
yeah
it 's starting to break up again
i hope not
oh really
mine too i think
i 'm waiting to get to number ten
yeah
number ten 's the one
no
i think they i did n't see when they mailed it
i know number ten is worth thirty dollars
they send you
yeah
then it 'll be worth it
otherwise you 'll have to just pay the bills with the money you get
right
right
right
right
right
right
right
so i think um town watch going on with the topic here town watch would be a a good vehicle f- to bring together people in the community as well as a safety precaution
eh and i think it would make people feel a lot safer
and it
really
uh-huh
uh-huh
feel a little more intimate
yeah
when people work walk um watching out for each other
and it feels as though you got a a piece of the rock there
and um then in turn you i think we would have a du- if we had a um
i do n't know if they have one in this community or not
whether they have a town watch or not
but no one has approached me
so um if they had then i would feel a little more safer with a town watch in addition to the um the strong police presence that we have here
um but um we live on campus
but our car was broken into a couple of times
and the mirror was broken
and that make me say well the police presence is n't helping the little petty crimes that we 're having
yeah
the little vandalism and
yeah
yeah
and um
a lot of times um the littering and things is n't curbed by the police
and that 's very unattractive
yeah
yeah
yeah
it just makes me not feel too good
so i think a town watch would help that
and in addition to making me feel safer would make me feel good a- and make life a little prettier
yeah
yeah
exactly
exactly
more pride
so m- what else
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh god
oh
ew
so what did you say ew the whole time
i mean i could say that for six minutes
with a topic like that
ew ew
well could we call the police
i mean that would make me feel unsafe
if that happened i 'd definitely would 've called the police
man that 's nasty
so you have n't gotten a check either huh
ah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh i hope so
that would be good if they were diligent like that
but i do n't know
it 's u. of p.
so you 're not going to be living on campus when you go to art institute
or
no
and some of the other stuff i added recently
um right
mhm
well
oh
ginkgo uh ginkgo biloba
uh-huh
yeah
i would uh um
i would like to see some of it regulated only for in terms of not represis- representation of what they do but hm according to potency
like do when you take a supplement is it really thirty milligrams of c. o. q. ten or fifty milli- something else
because it 's not regulated nobody cares
i i it could be
it could be
so it 's it 's um it 's kind of questionable
now some of the things you can get prescription uh uh what they call prescription grade
uh i know c. o. q. ten if your doctor prescribes it you can get uh prescription grade
and i also have potassium pla- uh tablet
and it comes in a ninety-nine milligrams because a hundred milligrams is prescription
so they make it ninety-nine
so i guess that must mean they they have some sort of quality control
so um i 'm trying to think of oh herbal supplements
do i try herbal supplements
uh not really
how about yourself
no
oh okay
i know this soy thing that i wa- that i was taking i just ran out a couple days ago was clover leaf extract or something like that
but there 's als-
hm
no
it 's just been fairly recently
yeah
now i know with um there 's also things like grape seed extract or pine bark
but i i do n't think i ever tried pine bark because that does n't sound like food to me
does n't sound like a food product
or a um you know what i mean like grape seed extrac- extract is like i guess some of the ingredients like you 'd have in wine
so i guess you 've been doing this uh ha- um half a dozen calls already
or
okay
yeah
i think it 's th- i think this is my eighth
uh i was told no actually a friend of mine was told after ten calls you can start receiving calls now
you 're receiving calls right
oh
huh
see i do n't leave my cell phone on
so i could n't receive calls
i 'd leave it off
oh
on your c- on your home phone
so in other words
oh
i see
okay
so in other words you 've been receiving calls
have you made any calls
oh
two calls
oh
see i did n't know
so so like uh from the very beginning you were receiving calls
oh
hm
right
right
right
right
i know uh uh i i heard that also because i tried to make a call on saturday
and i got a recording saying you ca n't make it within twenty-four hou- within a day
but i did n't make any on saturday
but i made the fri- friday night call late
and then i was trying to make the call like in the afternoon
and they and i- and it hung up on me
yeah
it says you ca n't make a call within twenty within twenty-four hours
oh re-
oh really
oh okay
yeah
i have n't so far i have n't hung up on anybody
or and i have n't received any calls
so that would n't be the case
uh-huh
huh
well i do n't i i was thinking about doing um like a calcium supplement
but i n- i never did because i mean i do n't drink a lot of milk or or eat too much dairy
so i do n't know
but i do n't gosh i guess i 'm not as concerned with that stuf- that much stuff as you
i think um like my mom was telling me to take like ginseng and something else that starts with a g. like that helps your memory
i do n't really rem-
yeah
but um no
i n- i never did take it
so like i do n't know
maybe i should look into that stuff
i 'll a- i 'll ask my doctor
but i do n't really take very much
but um
mhm
mhm
so
oh
so it does n't matter what they 're put on the bottle
i mean could they be lying
is that what you 're saying
or
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
mhm
oh that 's good
that 's good
well
i had something
no
no
i do n't really do any of that stuff
well
mhm
do you feel
do you feel different now that you have n't taken it in a few days
i mean does it
n- oh yeah
hm
yeah
right
right
hm
yeah
i think this is my sixth call right now
yeah
yeah
yeah
i 've i 've been receiving calls all week
so
yeah
you i-
you receive your calls on your um home phone
not your cell phone
yeah
the onl- the only time you use your cell phone is when you 're making a call
yeah
yeah
i made two calls
and i
i 've received all the others
but th-
yeah
yeah
but the thing is though um if you receive a call you ca n't you ca n't make a call
you can only do one per day
so um like if i g- eh since i got your call i ca n't make any calls later on in the day
so
i mean
mhm
oh really
oh really
i d- i did talk to somebody one day
and um they eh were disconnected with me
and i assume that the the call did n't count because i got another call the same day
so i guess you have to talk for like the whole time period before you get credit for it
because
you know other countries that can change on a whim as to what you can and ca n't do
and i do n't know
i just you know
yeah
that might make it doable
but we have a large family
so it it would be that your you know unless you could h- have enough to bring them over all the time
yeah
it
yeah
see you 're younger
but so it might not be as ea- as effective for you
but like my husband has seven siblings
and they all have children who have children
and
yeah
and i have three siblings
and plus i have four children who all have children
so i would be giving up a lot because i would n't really see my grandchildren grow up
and there is n't a whole lot that 's worth that
yeah
well even my kids
ma
you know
but uh my grandchildren
i do n't know about that one
i do n't know if i 'd want to miss them growing up
you know
your
uh-huh
no
because it 's it 's like you know with your own children
it eh they 're everything 's changing so quickly
and you miss all of that
and i would miss my kid
and seeing them every few months or ev- once a year or something just kind of
i do n't know
we 're a close family
you know we 're a very close-knit family
and um our son just had cancer this year
who 's he 's thirty-three
so
yeah
well he 's doing well thank god
but we would n't have been able to come home and be with him
you know that 's pretty limiting
so uh there is n't any amount of money in the world that can take the place of you being with somebody that you love when they need you
so i i do n't think i 'd do it
you know i me- i 'd be tempted
na- i- sure does n't
it sure does n't
yeah
well the-
yeah
yeah
well you figure when you get uh a million dollars what do you end up clearing out of it
maybe five hundred thousand or a little bit better
you know yeah
so that 's that 's not a whole lot of money
it 's three or four years of wages
five years of wages maybe at what you 'll be making
you know hopefully what you 'll be making
yeah
that was that was the biggie
you could never come back
you know that would mean giving up your citizenship basically
and i do n't think that 's worth a million dollars
oh yeah
yeah
well we go to hawaii all the time
an- uh we 've been to alaska
we went on a cruise last year
and we went to um uh turkey and athens and greece
and in fact on the twenty-ninth yeah
on the twenty-ninth we 're going on a cruise to barcelona and venice and paris and rome and sicily
and then we 're coming back and going to hawaii for two weeks
so
yeah
i 'm a gypsy
you know somebody says to me you want to go
i 'm i 'm say yeah
where
yeah
it does n't even matter
i 'll just go
yeah
right
yeah
well that 's what we did we did with renaissance
we went on a two for one
for athens it was like thirty-five hundred dollars for the two of us to go for twelve days
yeah
it 's like man you ca n't beat that
you know so this one 's a little more expensive
but even at that it it was n't that bad
it 's seven thousand dollars for two people f- for fifteen days
and that you 're on the ship the whole time
so
yeah
meals and everything is included
so it 's like you know
it leav- yeah
it leaves out of j. f. k.
so i figure i can go other places and not have to give up my citizenship
yeah
yeah
yeah
so you know that that would be the big kicker
giving up your citizenship
i do n't think i 'd want to do that
you know so but with you i mean you 've got your whole career ahead of you
and you have a lot of potential
so you know it would be a l- a big change from you
yeah
what if it were five million
would you uh consider it then
i might for five million because then you know you can live at a at a level of comfort eh uh that uh you know might make it might make it doable
that 's that 's true
i agree
uh i 'm the same way
oh
so you have a big family
that 's that 's true
i agree with you
i agree with you
yup
or that 's true
my i 'm sure my dad we have a i have a six year old niece
that 's my parent 's first grandchild
and
yeah
uh the same way
they 're about your age too
i think my dad is fifty-eight
uh
yeah
they would n't leave for anything to miss her growing up
it 's not not the same
oh
i 'm sorry to hear that
good
sure
i 'd i 'd be tempted too
but eh
yeah
and for especially for a million
that does n't go as far as it used to
right
eh they do n't tell you if it 's before taxes after if you have to pay foreign taxes or what
i got to think of all those things too
but you 're right
it 's not enough
and i i i doubt any amount would be
oh yeah
five six hundred thousand
that 's it probably
right
and the and the question was
right
well and the question was you could never come back
so i mean
yeah
have you visit- have you been able to travel uh in your lifetime
is there any place that is your favorite where you cou-
oh
wonderful
oh
fantastic
oh
that 's great
oh
you have a lot in store
we-
that 's great
yeah
li- li- i found a great um cruise bargain on the internet this summer uh leaving from philadelphia going to bermuda
uh it was less than five hundred dollars a person
it was kind of a last minute rate
and uh me and five of my family members all went because it was so cheap
eh if it had n't have been i do n't think we would have been able to go uh you know on that short notice
but we could n't pass it up
and we had a great time
it was my first cruise
uh really oh my you ca n't beat that
h-
yeah
right
so your meals and everything
and where does that leave from
new york or where
j. f. k.
exactly
that 's right
you can hey
yeah
yeah
yeah
cruising has become so affordable and travel in general that uh you can still travel
i hope
yes
or you know just being on a um i guess uh faraway um what tropical island i guess it says
sort of
yeah
for ten years
i guess it says ignore what all finances and stuff
um when they talk about being on the island
i guess that really could just uh be about you know just getting away from everything
and um trying to see how you 're going to survive
and how would you live not having to worry about um any finances far as you know bills and you know cost of just buying things in general
i guess this is going to be on the kind of island like that
you 're going to live um whatever the island brings to you
i guess that could be um tropical stuff far as the fruits and berries
and i guess you could be getting um your far as like fish and all those sort of things
and crabs and all that
i guess you know you can live off them and eat like that forever
but but the thing is i think that would kind of be that 's too long
huh
ha i guess so
a peace of mind would be one of the things
mhm
uh-huh
yeah
mhm
stress free huh
okay
oh
you think you 'd pick what do you like about los angeles so much you think
be a nice place
okay
uh-huh
okay
right
i me too also
it 's the it 's a nice little getaway for a vacation
but i think after the vacation everything wears off
you know you 're back to civilization
you 're saying you know that 's back to where we 're from
i i think everybody likes to get away every now and then
well i never been to los angeles before
so i do n't know too much about that you know that place
uh-huh
right
okay
okay
right
okay
uh-huh
mhm
yeah
uh-huh
right
yeah
because see i do n't know n-
ha
i know about los angeles
but this bora bora really got me too
i think i would like to find little more information on about that place there
you know
and see what 's so different from any other place that you might want to tour you know in the future
it 's always good
uh-huh
oh
no
i have n't been to hawaii
but i hear it 's beautiful
uh-huh
okay
oh okay
it 's not bad
uh-huh
okay
oh okay
yeah
yes
mhm
really
i- i- that 's it 's just too much
yeah
it 's really too much
and
yeah
you just want to be somewhere where you going to if you 're going to vacation or any other place that you want to go
you just want it to be more laid back and comfortable
you want it to be enjoyment time
you know you do n't want to have to worry about anything
you 're leaving cares and stuff behind
so you can just relax and just sit back and observe and check the scenery out
yeah
for ten years
mhm
yeah
ten years
i
yeah
i i think that 's a long time
oh well it depends on how civilized it is there
now you know you go to a lot of islands
they 're better off than than we might be here in the united states
but if it 's
uh yeah
i 'd miss a good steak once in a while
i 'd miss uh i 'd miss a good beer or you know a glass of wine
but you know it it does sound intriguing
you know the uh uh the island life
um you know less pressure of the big city uh i mean when you compare it to the to the ro- you know the uh i guess stress of uh los angeles
but uh know what
i i 'll take los angeles
well i just think city life really
i i 'm ah i i 'm a city person
eve- ev- i i like the country i and the islands
but uh you know they the idea of going native uh is not that appealing to me for for ten years
right
yeah
you know i
it 's it 's probably another city t- like uh like any other
but uh i 've heard the the climate is nice
and that 's appealing to me
i i do n't like a lot of heat and humidity
and uh i think you get that on tropical islands
you do n't get it necessarily in los angeles
it 's a little uh less humid out there
and uh
even though and
yeah
uh the year-round w- warmth does n't necessarily appeal to me
but uh uh especially tropical warmth
and like i say i like i like city life
uh i 'd say for a short period of time yeah
i 'll go to bora bora
but back on what i m- m- you know maybe tomorrow i 'll look up exactly where bora bora is
ha ha
yeah
uh i mean he-
i would bet that it 's somewhere in the uh south pacific
you know just just as a guess
uh but you know i i 've been to hawaii
have you been to hawaii
oh it 's it 's fantastic
uh it 's uh the weather when i was there was fantastic because it has those those breezes
it 's not exactly in the south pacific
hawaii 's uh more more n- north of the equator
and the breezes that that come off the ocean are very very nice
it 's pleasant
it 's it 's uh when we were there i think it was uh i c- the temperature was in the seventies
and the ocean water was n't bad
uh so that kind of island yeah
i could hack that
you know but not tropical
not not the tropical heat
that 's
do you watch survivor
i don- i do n't like that uh environment
you know what i mean
the uh bugs and uh the heat
uh mm right
m-
i 'm in the car
what 's that
yeah
i could tell
you 're echoing
oh
uh
yeah
that 'll help
wh- where you at
philly
out oh okay
everybody i 've talked to so far has been from philadelphia

so i 'm like
they just keep buzzing me
i guess i 'm the only person available at nine o'clock ten o'clock eleven o'clock at night
hm

yeah
yeah
yeah
i 'm familiar with the whole area
i lived down in south jersey for f-
uh i lived in township since eighty-six
oh yeah
i was there fourt- yeah roughly thirteen fourteen years before i moved
so how long you been down there
okay
yeah
it 's only be- i only graduated eleven years ago
so
but how 'd you get hooked up on this phone thing
really
two hundred bucks a pop on the phone is not a bad gig
yes
nice
nice
yeah
i met a guy the other day that would n't give me his name would n't give me anything
and i was like do you want to talk
no
what do you mean no
i 'm like you 're g- you 're supposed to talk about something
and he 's like no i 'm not talking to you
all right
i sat on the phone in silence for six minutes
and then the lady came on and said you know you 're call 's now over
i 'm like all right
cool
click
hung up on him
he would n't speak
were yo-
yeah
sometimes it does
see- like the day i had the old lady that would n't talk about anything but the topic
i thought i was on there forever
i do n't know because i do n't i do n't know if i like have a quote unquote best friend
so in my situation
yeah
i 'd probably do it
ach
n- yeah
yeah
um
i do n't know that 's just a weird topic
yeah
yeah
okay
i guess we were the same person
yeah
i- it must have got disconnected somehow
yeah
yeah
that was uh quite interesting
i 'd be like there 's a fucking roach in my salad
i 'd flat out say it
i do n't care
there 's no way in hell i 'd pick around it or or finish it or be fake
i 'm like there 's a bug in my food
get it out
i was like i 'm going out to mcdonald 's and eat them roaches i ca n't see
yeah
that 's crazy
um i think about six times
i have it written down
so
yeah
but i did n't do it eve- every night
no
no
you get paid either way
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
i hear you
yeah
same here
yeah
i he- i hear it on my answering machine
and i 'm like uh okay
yeah
six months
oh
oh
i thought you meant the the the right this phone call right now
it 's uh
i i have no idea
that would be a possibility
i do n't even know how many i made total
they were written down somewhere
mhm
no
no
i have n't got anything
it probably takes some time in the process
um you know all that legal crap
uh-oh
that 's not good
yeah
yeah
well and i guess survey and then get too many um applicants for it i guess
so they need to call everybody
i do n't know
hm we 're not in october yet
yeah
mhm
yep
i read it when i 'm bored at work
yeah
really
right
ha ha
well if you 've got nothing to lose then so why not for it
oh no
but my phone j- was disconnected
i mean the call dropped a minute ago
and i had someone else calling me
and the topic that that one was was um if you were at your fiance 's house
oh
we the same people
you 're the same per-
y-
yeah
it dropped
but um now that topic there
you said you had that one before huh
what would you do
r- right
right
eh
right
uh right
exactly
yeah
for sure
how many times have you done this so far have they called you
oh
really
i do n't even remember how many times
did you start since the first night on the tenth
now do you have to in order to have it done do you have to be the one to call in
oh okay because i keep forgetting to call
i only remember once my phone rings
and it 's for me
and i know it 's them because you know i go to school at night
and i work in the day
so this is like the last thing on my damn mind
you know
i 'm i 'm not thinking about making a damn phone ca-
yeah
so
i just get the calls
i think it 's only missed me like maybe th- twice
maybe twice
mhm
mhm
but um
and we got until when
when is this over
in six months
w- i-
i forgot
actually actually i got the paperwork in the mail yesterday
i guess all i have to do is read that
and
yeah
here it is right here
yeah
let 's see
hm oh i do n't know six at least six calls
hm
hm
hm
hm
yeah
now initially they had told me that um they were going to send out a twenty-four dollar check after two days that you 've had a call
each after each two days you would get a check
eh they would send out a check in the mail
have you gotten any check
me either
mhm
eh yeah
and then the other thing was i told them to call me between five and seven
and i 'm getting calls all the time after ten o'clock at night
but it 's a it 's been okay because i 'm able to take the call
but that 's not the time that i agreed to
mhm
yeah
yeah
well i i think they s- i thought they said it was going to be over on the
well maybe not the was it the eighteenth of october
i do n't know
yeah
yeah
but i forgot what date it is
i do n't know i g- like i said i got this thing in the mail
i just got to read it through to see when this thing is over
and is this the first time you 've done something like this
me too
but i 'll you got it out of the city paper
mhm
eh so that 's
really
n-
yeah
this is a my mom told me about this one
so i had grabbed the city paper another time before because i hardly ever read the city paper
i 'm i 'm trying yo- i 'm trying to get my i 'm trying to get my credit together because you know everything 's based on credit
you know when you go f- when you when you go for the house you know and everything
i said well damn
you know it 's
now since i 'm going
yes
i said well i said look i 'll go through the trials and tribulations right now
you know i act like i know
pay- i paid my landlord the rent
i paid the storage people
the storage people will not hesitate to sell your stuff
eh oh yeah
oh yeah
you forty you f- you forty-five you forty-five well it used to be thirty
now i guess they got hit with a couple of law suits
it was forty-five days from the date of your due date
you know so if you due on the first you got forty-five days to pay that rent
you know if you do n't pay it they put a little thing in the paper
uh it cost seventy-five dollars
and they sell your stuff
now if you owe like three hundred and fifty dollars you know your stuff is more than three hundred and fifty dollars
okay
so they get over
yeah
man
yeah
um university city would be nice because of the houses
now the rent is rent is expensive uh way up in mount what 's that chestnut hill because it 's quiet

i 'm like what is going on
but i wan- i want to you know i want to have i want to have ch- um i i would like to h- a nice three story house would be nice
you know
okay
i- i 'm trying to get into one of them programs you know that they look at your income
you know
okay
this is your income
that because
okay
i 'm spending three hundred i 'm spending almost four hundred dollars
i can mess around and have two three houses yo- you know according to the mortgage
but you got to have your credit together
you know you know and getting credit k- get get the credit together and you know that 's that
yeah
yeah
what 's what 's with that

oh it was
oh
okay
so what 's the deal with that
uh uh the
okay
first time buyers
you uh your cr- your credit 's messed up
did they help you
okay
yeah
because i i d- i did a little you know background checking
and i 'm like you know just g- just give me a house
you know so i want
mhm
what
right
yeah you know i got a couple
yeah
i got a couple credit cards
you know how them credit cards is
you know they preapprove you
and you act like you know
uh i 've been with one for a year
i 'm getting ready to be with another one for a year
so i 'm going to use them and you know the kitchen sink too
yes i do
yes
that 's it
i 've been
i 've been there brother
i 've been there
i tried to you know
right
right
what
oh man
i 'd be m-
oh
right
oh man
i never heard that before
that 's no joke
so so where where would you move if you were going to move
okay
right
yeah
you well you-
yeah
yeah
it 's well tha- that 's all like west mount airy up that way
you 'd be believe it or not charlie you could find some nice spots up there for not not too bad
right
right
right
something just kind of in ch- kind of away from things
right
no doubt
right
definite-
i hear you
right
right
right
right
and no doubt
no doubt
yeah
i hear you partner
i hear you
you 're right though
you 're right
i tell yo- i 'd tell you what
i don- i do n't know if you 've ever looked down in south philly
but they got a lot of three three story houses in south philly that are n't definitely are n't too bad
mhm
yeah
yeah
yeah
that credit 's important
i know that uh i tried i tried looking at possibly uh getting a f- a first time buyer 's loan
and they were like stiff
you c-
you can definitely you can definitely qualify for first time buyers
but uh i mean i 'm uh my credit is is you know kind of banged up
so it 's like i 'm in the same stage
i got to repair my stuff too man
they should be able to
but i think mine was messed up beyond belief
so i 'm like i 'm uh i 'm on my way of working it to the point where like i i met with a guy and he was like look adam
i 'm sorry
i ca n't do nothing for you
but uh you come back i-
you know what
you know what though
i i think that if you as long as see as long as you 're you 're staying consistent and and up up on your bills they will they will take that as like okay
well you know what you know mister mist- you know mister f- ed you can handle those bills man
you can handle them
so eh you know we should be able to hook you up
but i fell i fell behind
you know
yeah
they 'll be a they 'll be to your advantage
right
he kicks back kicks back and relaxes a little bit with a cigarette
right
right
yeah
no
i 'm i 'm very sensitive to the smell and and i- to all that kind of stuff
so i mean i can if i can whiff of it in a restaurant it really bothers me and bothers my eyes
so
yeah
at
mhm
uh my g- yeah
my place is the worst
i work at a m- a large mortgage company
and uh
yeah
everybody 's real big on the smoke breaks
and if you walk out the door and you just walk through it it 's just like walking through clouds of smoke to get to your car
yeah
no
i mean i- they do n't have any rights
as far as i 'm concer- no
i mean to be hon- no
uh you know what it it 's causes cancer
my my father had cancer
and it had to have been from his smoking
i mean it 's i- they i- i mean i- they know that eh it causes bladder cancer and different types of things
and you know i mean if you 're breathing it in i mean i think your rights stop when you 're affecting other people
and there 's no question about it anymore
so
um i do n't know
i mean i think
right
right
no
i mean i i see your point
and i see their point
but you know life is life is a lot of gray areas
and life is a m- matter of choices
and you have to make a choice
so
you know
right
hm
yeah
i guess it is more complicated more of a complicated issue than at first it seems to be
well it 's funny
i know we 're getting off the topic
but we t- we talked a little about the topic
so i 'm going to switch here
no
i it 's funny
i 've had this bug lately about just checking out the west coast
uh i went to arizona a few weeks ago
my brother 's out there
um and i just keep hearing about california san diego san francisco
and i 'm just toying around with the idea of possibly relocating
just i do n't know just i i heard that it 's just more naturally beautiful and just a nicer way of living out there
the people are maybe just friendlier
so i do n't know
what i- what do you think
i mean what made you move here from the west coast
oh
okay
were you born out there
oh
okay
yeah
well what do you what do you have to say about l. a. and that area
mhm
right
the i mean the
well there 's a lot you can do here
i mean i w- over the weekend i was up in manhattan at the san gennaro festival the big italian festival
and just i mean there 's just you know you can drive to the shore to philly to new york to d. c.
so that 's the the only thing i was kind of concerned about is that i d- i just heard that there 's just i guess less
so he 's not like a day time in the car chain smoker kind of person
so it 's only
hm
yeah
at at night only
so maybe you know three a night or something like that while he 's watching television
so it has never really bothered me
but i have n't been around people who excessively smoke either
and sometimes when you go to restaurants and they put you in the quote unquote nonsmoking section it 's still horrid
it 's like
yeah
especially at at work too you know when you have people standing outside on their fifteen minute break
uh-huh
right
oh like why i hold my breath
like do n't like to breathe till i pass
but i think you know for uh for the most part i know that people it 's really sensitive topic because i know when they were talking about doing it up in princeton you know the people were were just up there pitching a fit about oh it 's not fair
smokers ' rights
you know and i guess they just do n't understand like
mhm
right
right
but i think they still public places should also include you know for what people want to do
like you go to the airports
i know w- i travel a lot
and i see people in this little room because it 's the one smoking room
and they 're in there like junkies
you know and they feel that that kind of infringes upon you know they need they have to be excluded or singled out to keep up a habit that they want to keep up
so that 's not really a public place
that 's kind of segregating them if you will
and i i kind of understand that from a- from that point of view
but when we 're talking about airspace
right
and when you smoke you 're like making a choice for people around you because if i have to breathe too you know you 're polluting my air
but i do n't think it 'll ever get i do n't think that the that it 'll ever get passed out here
i just noticed that more people smoke out east
that 's i- it just seems that way
okay
mhm
oh okay
um
uh i well my job moved me
so it was n't like i had a choice
but um i do n't know
i i i do think that people are
no
actually i was born in chicago
but i 've lived most of my life in l. a.
and i
i just think that um well people like you said earlier are a little more health conscious
they are healthier definitely
i guess because you 're exposed a little more
and with better weather people are a little more in shape and very very health conscious
um i think on the whole eh generically i would say yeah
nicer
they are
people here seem to be uptight about a lot of things
and i do n't know if that 's cranky because of weather or you know gray days or whatever
but the people here are a little more uptight
um scenically it 's i do n't know
i mean there 's eh beautiful things about the east coast too
but um you know
mhm
right
yeah
definitely
yeah
definitely
no
you know what i really am not sure
probably definitely unliti- uh unlimited cash flow
that 's that 's a big plus
probably a home of my own
you know i 'm in an apartment with a friend
and
yeah
and um i do n't know
you know i guess it all boil- boils down to being comfortable
yeah
mm
yeah
no worries
yeah
that 's a good one
are are you outside
are you outside or inside
oh
oh
oh
oh
that 's nice
oh my god
uh
eh yeah
what time you got to get up
oh that 's not bad
oh man
yeah
oh
yeah
it is
are you in re- are you in retail
oh
oh
well that sounds interesting
mhm
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
that sounds interesting
mhm
right
that is really nice
yeah
yeah
yeah
but that 's boring
it can be
it 's it 's actually more fun i think to meet to always meet different people
but then every day in a different place might get monotonous
yeah
oh yeah
i
that sounds interesting though
how 'd you get involved in that
oh
oh
do you like it here
yeah
it is
yeah
mm
yeah
yeah
that 's true
really
mhm
mhm
right
right
yeah
it 's a good what place
yeah
oh yeah
mhm
my whole life
yeah
ex- i m- moved to florida recently
but it wa- it was really laid back
really laid back
and i 'm not used to it
yeah
i 'm born and bred in philly
so i 'm back home now
um a couple of years
yeah
i broke up with my fiance and said i 'm out of here
he goes uh eh he goes uh where
i go florida
he goes you 're moving out of state
and i said uh yup
i 'm out of here
so i moved out of state
and
yeah
yeah
it really does
it really does
you come back with a clear head
um hm let 's see
um maybe something like um
i do n't know unlimited cash stores
bills would n't be an iss- someone to pay my bills
how about you
any ideas
right
oh yeah
mhm
mhm
right
ditto
right
no worries
excuse me
um actually i 'm driving home
i had uh just met some friends um for uh dinner
and uh we went out dancing
and uh my friends were getting tired
and i have to work in the morning
so we were like okay
let 's call it a night and go home and get some sleep
um i 've got to be at work at nine
and it 's like an it 's like an hour drive
i like do a lot of traveling
so so the place i 'm going to tomorrow is like an hour away
so
it 's early for a saturday
too early for a saturday
um actually i i work in health services
so like i do a lot of traveling
and i i check out a lot of like different clinics and lots of different centers and see how they 're running
and you know like
bring them information and you know kind of help them out when they 're like short-staffed
so it 's kind of neat
you know you get to s- you get to see a lot of different people
and you 're never at the same place like every day
which is kind of nice
um of course then again you know there is something nice about being in the same place every day
like you know what to expect
you know what your schedule is
yeah
it can be
yes
yes
yeah
right right e- every once in a while it does get a little stressful
but sometimes you know you try and get them to schedule you at least in the same area
you know or like the same place a couple days in a row
that 's that 's pretty good
you know i just sent my resume everywhere like about a year ago
um like actually i was living down in baltimore
and i thought i was going to move to to uh washington d. c.
so but i just sent it to like you know all the all the different cities and it got picked up here
so i said okay
i guess i 'll move to philadelphia
i do
i 've been here a year
and i think it 's a great city
um it 's got s- there 's there 's so much
like in comparison to baltimore which just is a r- it 's you know it 's it 's a big city
but it 's still got a small town feeling to it
um it 's not as big as philadelphia by far
um so it 's
i i definitely i definitely like philadelphia better
there 's more to do
and there 's more di- the the people are mi- more diverse
um like in baltimore everybody 's the same
which is comfortable
mean not i mean it 's
i 'm i 'm being stereotypical
but i mean it it 's a comfortable city
it 's like a great place to settle down and raise a family um like because it 's got a lot of resources that s- cities have
but it 's a lot quieter than say like philly new york or like boston
or you know
it 's a bit tamer of a place
it 's a t- it 's a bit tamer like than philadelphia
it 's not it 's the pace is slower
so what do you live in philadelphia
really
uh-huh
really
aweso-
how long were you in florida
oh
yeah
ach
well there 's nothing like a change of environment
you know it does wonders
it really does
mhm
on t. v. for their like entertainment purposes
i think that 's like really wrong and immoral
right
right
right
are you talking about mumia abdul jamal
the guy who 's going to be sentenced to death sent- to a death se- sentence
is that who you 're talking about
in philadelphia
yeah
his name 's mumia abdul jamal
nah i do n't really know
but i know that they 're trying to they 're trying to kill him
yeah
he 's from north philadelphia
yeah
right
right

yeah
well um there 's i heard on the news about uh this one guy that killed a cop
now he done did like at least thirty-five years in jail
and they do n't want to let him out because he killed a cop
right
wel-
i do n't know
i just heard
i do n't know who it was or whatever

was n't he
what
well they say w-
yeah
well they say wel- the way i got it they do- they they want to let him go
and somebody up in the- then they want to k- you know keep him in jail
i do n't think it had nothing to do with killing him or nothing
but they want to keep him in jail
i said the man did all that time
regardless who he killed you know you should 've let him go
th- i mean they have other people that that killed cops
and they 're out you know and stuff like that
they have killed other people
and they out

me neither
me neither
i mean ai n't noth- ai n't nobody going to make me do nothing to them that you know that will carry a time like that

yeah
that 's nice
how long have you lived in florida now

wow
that 's eh something interesting
uh-huh
oh okay
that 's nice
well i hope i 'm as lucky as you when i retire
live in florida
sense of living
yeah
yeah
yeah
me either
i do n't know what else to talk about either
yep
yep
yep
yeah
yeah
oh yeah
yeah
we go fishing
and we have a boat
we got out on the boat twice two or three times a week at least
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
oh yeah
they 're
yeah
they 're well two of them are in jersey
and one 's in florida
yeah
yeah
they 're all married
and
yeah
yeah
yeah

no
no
i used to live in jersey
yeah
right
yeah
i worked for uh con ed in new york
public utilities
yeah
yeah
thirty-three years
yeah
yep
yep
oh
we got quite a few new yorkers down here
yeah
yeah
oh yeah
sticks with you
yeah
yeah
well you work for the company
or
oh
uh-huh
right
right
right
yeah
sure
right
yeah
yeah
i called before
when i called i was on for about eight minutes
and i got no one
i finally said the hell with it
you know
oh and then when the phone rang i said i bet you it 's probably someone calling me now
and that 's what it was
yeah
yeah
because i was in it last year
they had the same program
yeah
but uh they gave a little more money last year
yeah
they were giving like twelve dollars a call
right now it 's nine dollars
but the tenth one i think you get thirty dollars
and then it then it goes up
uh yeah
they were
eh yeah
and they just wanted to try it again
i guess they they were giving out quite a few mo- uh money last year
yeah
that toward the end if you made your twelve calls uh they gave uh they had uh like a pool
and somebody won uh five hundred bucks
yeah
right
oh
i r- i really do n't know
nah
no
i was n't into it that much
yeah
it helps pay the phone bill
that 's what
oh ri-
yeah
oh yeah
yeah
it was up-
is it
oh
in the high nineties today
ninety-six ninety-seven something like that
yeah
oh right
yeah
oh you 're probably getting that storm that we had a couple of weeks ago
yeah
we had er a hurricane
yeah
gordon
you 're on your phone right
right
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
right
you do n't need that stuff right
yeah
yeah
oh yeah
nah
not really
yeah
about five years
yeah
yeah
oh we usually we spend a lot of time up north
we grew up we got friends in jersey
we 're up there quite a bit
uh we got uh friends in ohio
we got out there and see them
so
yeah
there you go
there you go
if you like the sun this is place to be
yeah
i do n't know what else to talk about
that is true
mhm
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
it 's weird
but i- i- it 's sort of every- i mean it 's kind of hard to stay in boundaries you know with the so much stuff that 's out now
you know yeah everybody can look at it and then say like you know well let 's take a look
um what 's that w- what 's the book
um alice in wonderland
you know you can take it as many ways as you want
you know but everybody could find like
okay
some racism in there
you could probably find some you know um sexual things in there
you know oh definitely too
you know that 's
they 're they 're taking hallucinogens
you know
uh yeah
tell me about it
yeah
oh i did n't hear that part
mus- sounds good
mm
yeah
there was n't any books banned at school
seriously
how old are you now
okay
yeah
i 'm twenty-two
yeah
it feels like six years ago
i mean there was n't that much internet use back in the day
yeah
j- it was just coming out
yeah
mm
when they say the media they mean um you know television stuff like that
yeah
but another thing is you p- you pay for these things
you know so if you did n't want to to um to buy it you should n't go see it i mean if you did n't want to see it you should n't go pay for it
you know
yeah
it 's true
i was wa- i was just watching wrestling
you watch wrestling
yeah
and stone cold came on back tonight
and you know he 's up there cursing and everything like that
you know
i can see ho-
yeah oh my goo- it was
he beat the crap out of a couple people
announcer
he he he h- he hit somebody in the head with a beer can
you know
it was uh he gets up
yeah
it does
i could tell
eh yeah eh yeah kids d- do get a s-
and if you know someone says something to them you know do n't much matter how big they are you know giving stone cold one finger salute
you know
mm
no
i do n't believe they can shoot people
you know you got to get that insane maniac who that could do that
i mean eh really it 's kind of hard to say if eh you know like say marilyn manson or eminem and all those like characters make people go out and kill people
you know these people have to have uh some kind of
i do n't want to talk these people um must have some kind of like you know other issues
you know eh yeah it 's definitely other issues in that
eh they just may have been listening to something eh like that
but there was other things that were provoking them to go and do something like that
you know i 'm not going to go kill seven people because i hear uh some rap
you know it just it 's not going to happen
yeah
mm
definitely
um i think they want to ban books like eh i do n't know huckleberry finn things like that
i- i do n't really know
i have n't read that much literature myself
so i do n't really know too much about it
but um i know that um i do n't know some people think it 's li- it 's political correctness
um but then um i guess i- i do n't know
i do n't know who wants to b- eh ban books
i think it 's mainly like conservatives that want to eh that ar- are worried about sort of non family values in books
is n't it is that true
or is it also it may also be eh sort of liberals who do n't want like i do n't know the racism and stuff like that in in older books
figure something like that
mhm
there 's definitely drug use in that
i 'm sure you could n't come up with that without some sig-
right de- defi- the mad hatter and um
i do n't think you could come up with a story at all without some significant drug use
hm so we 're supposed to do the media too
i d- i thought i thought they said something about the media
or uh i do n't know if there were any books banned in your school
see i do n't think there were any books banned in my school
you know of course with internet there was n't that much i- there was n't really much internet when i was in high school
so um
i 'm twenty-five
so are you older or younger
oh okay so you- you 're a little closer to high school
but not that close
um
well uh
yeah
we b- we barely we barely had it
but um we 're su-
yeah
ninety well ninety-three is when i graduated
so it was it was n't really an issue then
but now it 's a big uh definitely a big issue
the eh we 're supposed to uh talk about media censorship
should i forget what the question was
but uh i do n't know what do you think about
yeah
well i think the eh i mean the current issue is uh you know for at least with the presidential thing is uh you know uh saying there 's too much violence in i think it 's mainly mo- movies t. v. things like that
video games
right
i think tha- i think that 's eh pretty much the best point
that um the uh the argument is something uh like i do n't know i think they 're worried about kids
um
oh yeah
is that right
but i mean do you think this really affects kids or not
it does
yeah
i gue- i guess that 's true
yeah
but i mean do you thin- eh do you think it just makes them like wres- uh mess around and you know horseplay
or do you think it actually makes them go in and shoot people and kill people
huh huh
definitely
definitely
yeah
yeah
yeah
i do n't think so
they do n't they do n't uh it 's probably it 's too much of a hassle to make a law about it
it 's really quite a
eh probably government should not be in it i think
uh i mean for the most part
um let 's see what else is trying to be banned
video games
first i would make myself acquainted
i 'm going to be here with these people
right
and then i would see what we had in what we would have in our carry on bags that you carry on the plane that we could use for a little while
then we would try to find something uh uh some first aid to get the pilot
you know so he could get the plane generated
but in the meantime we would gather up the bags
everybody takes food
anywhere you 're you travel anywhere you always got something to eat
so we would take and put the bags together
maybe somebody has some water
somebody has some juice
somebody has some chips
somebody has some peanuts
and uh then there 's a little baby
so uh we take the uh the uh
so we take you know the uh you know those uh s- seat covers they have on the back
well the girl said that she only bo- bought two pampers because she thought it was only going to be a three hour flight and the baby could do
so we 're going to take all those and we 're going to use those for pampers for the baby
so the baby will survive and not be pee pee
okay
now we have to worry about something to eat for the baby
but really our uh i would uh go around like i said to everybody
i 'm i 'm a really out person
i 'm a really outgoing
you know so it would n't take me uh long to go and find everybody 's
oh and they 'd probably would send me up and and uh check on the pilot
yeah
yeah
no
no
scared to death of blood
ah the sight of it just f-
but they 're sending me up because they said only he just passed out
and you know those things do happen
you know they say you know how sometimes a plane is just up in the sky and all of a sudden it just booms drops down
do you think the plane just drops down because it just drops down
right
or they uh or get in conversation
they put it on autopilot
and they get to chit-chatting chatting
and and the next thing you know it 's down in the sea or no- in your trees or in somebody 's yard or on their house or some way
you know what i mean
yeah
yeah
those things do happen
f- forever oh
okay
you thinking like t- on the survivors were it w-
y- right
yeah
a little of this a little s-
right
uh-huh
yeah
okay
true
uh-huh
yeah
a- train no
oh okay
yeah
but w- b- you you brought up a good point out there
definitely
the the planes are not maintained
any time you take a plane from one s- uh side of the world almost to the other and it 's sitting down on the ground for two hours and it 's back up doing the same thing back and forth and this is a twenty-four hour ritual and it 's not sitting on the ground long enough for n- no real mechanic to put any real parts or do any real work to it you 're you got a point there
you got a
right
mhm
mhm
oh okay
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
we steal the baby 's formula
o-
yep
right
as long as the baby 's breastfeeding
oh
right
mhm
oh no
i can tell that already
you 'd be the master here
you 're the one
you know we we cross you we 're dead
oh okay
are you a nurse
are you a doctor
oh
oh really
so
but they 're sending you up there
huh
to check on the pilot
oh okay
pilot did n't die
really
mhm
mhm
something happened to the pilot
mhm
mhm
yeah
wow
well you see you went right for the i 'm thinking about long term
you know when you said that i was thinking i 'd be stuck on this place like for a long long time
yeah
but you know you you kind of oriented it towards this was a short term
and let 's just see what we 're going to do to survive for the short term
yeah
so i was thinking along different lines
but excuse me
yeah
you pose a good point
i mean i guess in the short term a lot of things could happen
i do n't fly dorothy because i truly do n't fly
and i flew a lot when i was going to college because i lived my folks are in upstate new york
and i went to school part of the time in florida
and i flew back and forth a lot
but these days i do n't fly
and my reason for that is because i do n't trust the federal aviation authority which i think is a big joke to actually be regulating any of these airlines because i think the airlines have gotten greedy
they 're capitalists
and they 'll do whatever they have to to save a buck
and so there 's all kinds of shoddy work being done on the planes
they 're not maintained on time
and i think the older the fleet gets the longer and this is for all the airlines the less safe the planes become
and there 's nobody that 's not being paid off or truthfully has the staff to regulate it
so c- my concern is that anybody who really is flying especially an airlines that that originates in this country has really got a lot to think about because it 's like ru- you 're playing russian roulette every single time you go up there
i mean too blame planes have gone down in the last ten years for my comfort level
so i do n't fly
i wo n't let my daughter fly
i mean maybe we 'll fly one time together when she graduates high school in a few years to take her on one big trip
but as a rule i 'm not one of these people that jumps on an airplane for a vacation
we go by car wherever we can go by car
i would go on a train
yeah
i have n't
but i would
you know
so that 's
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
yeah
well you know eh p- as i i 'm in my i 'm going to turn fifty next month
and what i 've seen over the course of my lifetime in this country is pretty sad
i mean we have become so greedy
and we have become so capitalist ultra capitalistic
okay
oh that 'd be awesome
mhm
okay
all right
i 've never even thought about that
happiness
lots of money
and i believe that money does bring happiness in in some senses
peop-
right
i like to be able to go in my bank account
and if i want to go away tomorrow i have it there
right
but you can do that with billions of dollars
you do n't have to have for a bag of money
sure
okay
oh sure
so if you want to go to england tomorrow you have pounds
if you want to go to italy you have lira
right
yeah
you had this question before though
uh-huh
th-
then then they have to take the taxes out of that
and then what ever else problems you get with all that money at once
then you have all these family you never knew about
right
oh i just had a little bit of savings put away
and i just wanted this really bad
mhm
how long have you been doing this then
oh alright
i 've seen it in the paper
yeah
this is like my sixth call
and i got a lot of friends on it
it 's weird because i thought i would get somebody i know on the phone eventually
but it 's not happening
okay
now some
boston
because a friend of mine talked to someone in florida
i did n't
a friend of mine did
and i was like florida
maybe they 're doing it in florida as well
okay
oh okay
i thought so
but
yeah
it is
it 's
now i never heard of th- well it 's the university of pennsylvania
okay
w- now maybe you can tell me
what are they trying to find out then
it 's not just about cell phones
you know what i 'm saying but with the bag whatever you whatever amount you need that 's what 's in the bag
you know what i 'm saying
so it 's a regular brown bag
you can keep it in your like you know bedroom or closet
no one 's going to steal it
no one 's going to take it
it 's just a regular brown bag
but if you put our hand in there and you think of like twenty thousand dollars twenty thousand dollars will come out
you know which is pretty cool
so then you have two extra wishes
and i do n't know what they would be
but they you know because then ya- you could save those in case of an emergency
you know
what about you
no
happiness would be good
lots of money would be good
i do too
i do too because you would be able to get things
i like to have things
you know i like material things
would n't that be awesome
you know like you just like you happen like but you know i feel like going to aruba
right
just feel like going to switzerland
you know and you just go
you do n't bring anything with you
you just go
but with the bag of money it was just good because you can you can like fold it up put it in your pocket
you know
you can go through customs
no one 's going to like you know stop you for carrying a brown bag folded up in your pocket
because nothing 's in it until you think about the amount of money you want
you know so you 're in switzerland
i do n't know what the what you know money they use
but let 's just say
okay
italy
they use a lira
so you m- ask for a million lira
you have a million lira come out of the bag
you know so it comes
yeah
that would be even cooler
it comes out in any denomination you want like any currency
any currency and denomination you want
you have pounds
lira
you go to germany you got deutschmarks
you know it 's like you 're covered
you go moscow you have rubles
you know it 's like you 're cool
and you can fold this bastard bag up
it 's like a lunch bag or something like that
or even it could be like a stop a shopping bag
you fold it up into a little pocket
you know you 're you 're good
is n't that sweet
that would be
that would be sweet
all right
so i 'm really proud of that little ah invention
and that 's cool
i did
i had the question the first time
i just said i won the million dollars
something like like a hundred million dollars or something
but then after it was over i fear i realize you know what if you had a fucked up genie
what if the genie said all right
here 's a hundred million dollars
bang
all in ones
or something like that
yeah
exactly
if some just like unloads like a hundred million dollars on you they 're going to want to know where you got it
how it came from
where it is
blah blah
where you 're going to put it
yeah
but the brown bag you can keep that on the d. l.
you can like no one has to know
until they start seeing you rolling up in like bentleys or something like that
it 's like where 'd you get this bentley
it 's like uh well i just happened to like find it
three hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars for a car
so
not too long
probably about maybe three weeks
a friend of mine works for the l. d. c.
and he told me about the whole thing
uh eh an- an- and you
the new ad in the paper
your sixth call
cool
no
no
i think there 's about three hundred people participating
so it 's a pretty large network
you know i know i 'm i 'm you 're calling me in boston actually
yeah
because i moved
and my friend who works there gave me the heads up in a e-mail
say hey do you want to participate in this prin- in a study
and i said yeah
definitely
but ordinarily i would have never known about it unless i did n't you know had a friend who works at the l. d. c.
you talked to someone in florida
really
no
i think it 's just like you know some of the f- people who work there have some friends
and they recruited their friends
you know because the it 's a local thing
that 's what i 'm told
yeah
unless i might be wrong
i do n't think they had enough money for advertising across like the country
but it 's an interesting study
yeah
it 's a pretty cool program
i think uh i i used to work there
and we used to do these studies too
yeah
yeah
that 's uh that 's that 's where i went as my undergraduate
yeah
it 's hard with with you 're supposed to eat all the vegetables and everything like that
when it 's easy just to grab a hamburger
and that 's what you want at the time
or you may want a can of pasta or something like that
and you ca n't necessarily have it because it 's not good
you know
uh-huh
uh-huh
go to mickey d. 's and get some fries
it 's already done
whereas you got to come home
and you got to cook the the greens and the string beans
and it may take a while
and right now america is busy
we we on the run
we we go go go
that 's why it 's the fast food places
and if they started selling more healthier stuff maybe people would get it
you know
eh yeah
eh for one grapefruit
uh-huh
yeah
yes
and it 's like the fast food be filling you up more even though it 's not nutritional or whatever for your body
it 's the vegetables and stuff
you be feeling so empty like thirty minutes later you be hungry again
so and you may have to work or whatever
you ca n't necessarily keep eating like that
so
huh
me too
yeah
yeah
uh mhm
yeah
yeah
yeah
it 's so weird just talk to me
yeah
so was i for school or whatever
i h-
i hear you
i hear you
yeah
well in getting back to the nutritional thing what i was saying about the carbohydrates
that 's usually what puts most of the weight on you
if you eh you know all the starchy foods like pasta and bread it 's almost inevitable for you to eat bread everyday like with a sandwich or with a burger or whatever you eat bread
or even egg roll if you like chinese food
that 's mostly starchy food
or even jamaican food
they give you all that rice
it 's a bunch of starch because starch is what fills you up fast
yeah
yeah
it fills you up fast
but it also puts the weight on you
what 'd you say
i- what 'd you say
i could n't hear you
you were breaking up
yeah
that 's not good
i just i just do n't know whether they 're working for me at all
yeah
uh eh i know especially that right n- now
i 'm like only f- why is like you know i do n't have money for all that sitting down and fixing food
like the the fast stuff is like you know i mean cheeseburger ninety-nine cent
i 'm like cool
i 'm with it
i can get me a cheeseburger
you know
that 's wh- that 's what i 'm s-
yeah
mhm
go go go
yeah
but see they but see they not because that 's how america make their money
that 's how they make their money off of that because it 's cheap
and it 's fast
and people always going to go
that 's how they make their money as well
now if they made uh a dol- ninety-nine cent veggie burger i 'd be like okay
they be just selling a hamburger dripped with um flame broiled and all this uh grease and and cheese and everything
i 'll try it
but vegetables and stuff cost too much
they 're not going to actually spend any money getting you know good food because it costs so much
like just to buy a grapefruit costs seventy-nine cents
or if i c-
for one grapefruit because i just i 've i 've been going to the gym
like um me and my girlfriend going to the gym about for two two months now
and i 've been going faithfully
but i mean one grapefruit because we eat a grapefruit after we get done that 's like seventy-nine cents
i go right to wendy 's and get me a a ninety-nine cent you know what i mean a double cheeseburger or something
and i be hungry
believe me
but um
i know
you 're hungry
i know yeah
because i got to go to work and school
so it 's like
like in like in today 's society anyway the biggest thing the biggest fad is like all these diets
like quick things
everybody 's like me
even looking for something to do as a as a diet like real quick because we want to lose that weight
we want something that oh you know what i mean will take our fat down
you know actually you know we c- we could do because i 'm looking for something
but i 'm not looking for something to make me smaller
i 'm looking to work with me while i 'm going to the gym you know as a aid or something to help me
you know what i mean just being
i learned about that because i i was like the d- fad diet queen
like oh this diet come out oh the hollywood diet
i 'm going to try this try this one
but nah i grew out of that already because it affects your body too much
too much than what you could think
so this 'll be your first call
huh
you did n't think it was going to at first my first call was last night
i did n't even think that 's how it was going to be
i was n't even expecting it
it 's was like the unexpec- like i did n't know what it was
i thought maybe you know they g- they prompt
you can call somebody
i did n't know
i did n't know
and this guy came on the phone and was like will you talk about this subject here
i 'm like okay
the guy came on the phone
i was like um how you doing
uh
yeah
my name is lolly
i 'm like oh gosh i feel so like stupid
yeah
but i was s- i do n't care
i do it because i was looking for the extra money
uh-huh
eh yeah
i need that i need that for my phone bill
i h- i spent my phone bill up to a hundred and fifty dollars
mhm
mhm
mm
oh yeah
and the starch just turns to sugar aft- later
but you know what i-
but the thing that also that 's bad that they just com- keep conveying is that now they have like the n- like the low calorie the i mean the low carb diet
it 's it 's good to i- it 's good to cut the the carbs out
but it 's not close enough
so that 's why i keep thinking it should be like half and half
like you you ha- you have to have everything that you make it is what you ha- cut it out
it 's breaking up
let me make sure i got something
oh what i was saying is like the carbs you know how they say like they have the diets now for like low carbs or no carbs and and protein everything
like i i do n't think you should cut carbs out period
i think you should have like y- y- y- your amount of carbs because it 's not good
like something is going to trigger
like one of my girlfriends she went on the low carb diet
yeah
there is a lot of walking involved here especially for college students
so you have to walk all over campus
but i do n't really consider that much exercise
mhm
ah
oh really
yeah
um what 's that
ah just one
yeah
before
yeah
yeah
mhm
twenty
oh wow
oh wow
um well let 's see hawaii is a beautiful place
um i go to university of hawaii in manoa
um i am dorming right now
i am actually in my dorm room right now
uh um i am majoring in psychology
so i am taking psychology classes along with a few other science classes right now
mhm
oh wow
yeah
um actually i have lived here for little over six years
but am originally from portland oregon
yeah
yeah
i was n't born here
yeah
um yeah
we moved here um right there the beginning of my eighth grade year
i moved with ah my mother my step dad and my younger sister
oh and i guess my older sister too
yeah
um there is i guess a decent amount
you can find something to do
they have on-campus jobs if anything
so it 's not a problem
yeah
i have n't got my first check yet
i just started this
uh just yesterday actually was the first time i got my call
yeah
yup
yeah
yeah
yeah
that will be cool
yeah
mhm
uh-huh
yeah
oh
yeah
so what month is that
gemini
june
oh really
what 's your uh what 's your actual birthday
really
june thirteenth for me
yeah
yeah
i like to talk
yeah
ah yeah
i know a few people on the internet
um actually i guess i guess you could say my girlfriend
i met her
actually i first met her elsewhere
but then i met her then i started talking to her online
i first met her somewhere else
but then that 's me and means of actually talking to her
mhm
oh wow
that 's very neat
right on
yeah
hey that 's very cool
oh wow
yeah
yeah
mhm
yeah
wow
yeah
yeah
yeah
mhm
oh well i do n't exercise at all because i have um a chronic condition called c. o. p. d.
and it 's um pulmonary a disease
so i ca n't really m- i do n't have a lot of mo- you know i do n't move around a whole lot
i ah basically kind of like stuck in houses
unless i have to go anywhere that i have to walk
i have to go in a wheelchair
so
yeah
so i looked this was a s- subject for me that i thought oh boy of all subjects to get right
have you be- have you done this call before
have you have you made these kind of calls before
eh
just one
oh
okay
i this is my first call to
so that 's why i am kind of fumbling around here a little bit
not sure how to how to proceed with it because uh i know how i know how important fitness and exercise is
and i when i was younger i used to do a lot of things
and but as i got you know i 'm fifty i am fifty seven years old
so i imagine your what
nineteen
twenty
twenty
i kind of thought so
i have a son older than you
i have a son that 's thirty-five
i 'm i 'm old enough to be your grandmother over here
well tell me little bit about yourself in in hawaii
and what are you what are you taking honey
oh
i use to be in um a director at erie business center here in erie
in a college with a business college though
i was assistant director dow- i- in here when i was able to work
ah that was quite interesting
so are you from hawaii
even your parents are born and raised there
oh
okay
because i did n't i did n't hear the hawaiian accent
i kind of thought maybe you know uh maybe you were n't born there
but uh
so have your parents lived there
or is this where you 're coming to oh you 've been there six years right
oh okay
uh is there lots of work in hawaii
mhm
oh and this still gives you and this gives you little bit of money too making these calls
how long did it take you to get your first check
oh
i 'll be darned
so how nice
so you 'll be getting some money
that 's so i will give you twenty bucks
i think it 's a neat idea
yeah
i just hope that the company is you know all that it it says it 's going to be
that will be nice
you can earn some money
uh
yeah
that will be ni- an easy way to make some money
i 'd like to talk on the phone
when i was before um well that was my job before i got to be assistant director
i use to um they said make telephone calls
telemarketers those uh type of people do n't want to hear
i used to call people on the telephone and run telemarketing rooms
so i used to love to talk on the phone
but i 'm a gemini
and geminis like to talk
yeah
ja- june
guess it
june second
oh so you 're gemini too
okay
so you like to talk
so that 's why you picked the telephone
okay
yeah
you like to talk
have you have you ever met anybody on the internet
oh did you meet her on the internet
mhm
well i 'll tell you a little nice story
i met my husband online
and he was in calgary canada which is about three thousand miles away from where i live
and we have now been married uh it will be four years in may
is n't it neat
we met online
yeah
we met online
yup
we met online
and we ended up getting married
and now uh he came he came three thousand miles to be here
poor guy
he did n't know what he was getting into
canada is so pretty compared to where i live
you know
calgary is so much more modern and nicer up there
but um
yeah
we ended up getting married
so you never know what can happen
that 's a little story huh
i mean that was when that was before the internet got bad with all the perversion and stuff that 's going on and stuff
but it was in the very beginning
you know people were having fun meeting each other
and none of these freakos are online
you know so to speak
right
right
right
right
it is
right
yes
and it helps you know um kids
uh not only kids but adults
all ages
you know um from preschool age sometimes younger ah on up um because we all use the computers
and you know the youngsters you know they may need help in pronouncing alphabets
and then we have adults who may have to turn in reports or or just you know look for information for whatever uh topic is needed or or where they have they have to do for school um or college
and um
so th- the computers i- i- i- it was who- whoever came up with it gave to whomever came up with it
uh i think i- it 's it 's great you know that they 've done that
it saves trips you know when you have to um uh have information and get get your um papers and everything together for school you can sit at in the comfort of your own home and go on your computer
you know an- and unfortunately though those who do not own their own computer they can go to the library and um look up any information that they need
you know so it 's it 's a great improvement
great improvement
mhm
mhm
right
are you talking about the college setting
where
yes
right
oh well yeah
yeah
that tha- great point
great point
great point
and then either you have some that would much rather do that than have the pressure of um a professor or teacher over them
so uh i- it could go both ways
but i think i would agree with you on that one
you know everybody has their own opinion
but i i stand in agreement with you on that one
um yet overall the computers um are a great addition to classroom
um for the te- it 's a help to the teachers
and it 's ah great aid to the students
um so i think it 's a great great help
hm
mhm
um
right
right
the computers also i think they are a great asset t- you know for intellectuals uh learning
you know uh in your spare time even away from the classroom just to study and and um improve on yourself and um probably get ahead in class also
improve on reading
improve in math eh the computer is is a great asset in so many areas
so
ah i live in los angeles
mhm
it has a great need for them here in this school system especially ah the public school system
so i i think it 's great especially when the computers are donated to help these kids and improving in their reading um and math skills um especially
i think those are skills that need to be strengthened in a great way
and uh along with the teachers i think that they they aid the children in a great way
yeah
so what about you
yeah
i 'd agree
um it 's just like another resource
um but like i guess it 's only uh as far as like learning in the younger ages when kids are just like starting to learn
not all kids have like good visual or like using it like the keywords that they 're not that good at like that 's sort of like tactile learning
but i mean like it 's probably pretty beneficial as a tool for like learning
he is like that way
uh-huh
uh guess
hm
yes
yeah
there is a lot of classes now there over the computer
like you do n't even have go to a classroom
makes it convenient
like i guess in like in like like black in some areas because you do n't have like you ca n't work in groups to do like projects if you are not like working with other students
maybe you 're like you do n't get the personality of like the professor
but could be convenient for like you both like thousands the time that they have
yeah
well you know how you can take classes over the computer
you do n't even have to go to a classroom ever
that 's what i 'm talking about
yeah
uh-huh
mhm
uh mhm
seems like it is
um before that they had typewriters
and it seems like now um kids that have like or learning from young really young age how to use computers
it 's just like this whole other world of information
and be first as that like this people without that knowledge do n't have like just using the internet
and you can like you like all this research and talk to you know e-mail people that are like
find all these resources over the internet
and it looks like a whole library right here at your fingertips
mhm
uh uh mhm
yup
where do you live
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yes
uh-huh
so
when i came out of school a lot of the diagnostic procedures were done manually
had to mix chemicals
do this
do that
do this
do that
but now all i need is one tube of blood and a um and um and this night machine and bloopsch
i mean all the analysis is just whewhit
you know i just just literally lay back there and listen to a walkman
i mean and i said well i said by the time i 'm thirty-five i 'll be be close to retirement
so it 's not going to make that much difference
but uh
yeah
a l- a lot of the technology that they ooh have you seen um um the new um what is it intel the intel
what is it
it 's a laptop that 's totally wireless
right
ri- eh
yeah
it 's totally wireless
and and i
mm
mm
right
because it it used to be a time that you had to have your cell phone at least with a laptop to make the you know actions and what have you
but um now now they just have uh uh certain laptops with intel in them
but i forget the name of it though
and as a matter of fact it was just advertised on t. v. jus- just yesterday
i mean it 's totally wireless
i think i 'm going to have to get one of those too
i do n't know what for
but just to have it i guess
so uh d- uh are you into computers much
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
mhm
yeah
mm
mm
well not really because see you going eh you s- you still going to have to utilize accessories um um for peripherals for your for your ports
you still going to nee- like for printers scanners you know things like that you still going to need them
so but it 's just basically for the internet
which i think is all right
you know i and that 's going to be int-
oh
uh-huh
you 're right
they do
i mean it 's just a whole array of information that 's on the internet nowadays but uh one could get into
you literally do n't even have to go to the library anymore
but you know
right
oh yes
oh yes
and in these search rims i mean you can just about find any and everything
you know any and everything
yeah
so what is your name anyway
vicky
that 's my sister 's name
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
so um listen
i 'm calling from los angeles
are you in uh the state of california too
or do you
oh okay
well i- i know it 's cold outside there now huh
yeah
uh-huh
okay
well vicky i 'm sure you have those little toddlers to take care of
and uh i guess my little ten minutes is up
yeah
you know this is it 's not a bad thing
i i think i get something like three calls on this
and how did you get introduced into doing this anyway
mhm
uh-huh
mhm
oh
i heard about that
i kind of seen it too
c- my husband gets those those computers
yeah
you heard about that because i was thinking i was like i wonder how would that be
get on the internet
and you do n't have to worry about the computer being hooked up to everything
uh-huh
that one
pretty much
like so my husband 's uh has his own computer consulting business
so i pretty much get more of the basics through him
he has shown me how to do things like downloading from like winzip and everything
and plus i mea- i like like the computer because i was saying i have a typewriter
and i 'm i was trying to get rid of it
and i thought you know i have a daughter here who might need a need typewriters eventually just to start out on
so they wo n't mess up the computer because i do that enough
so but i guess talking about the wireless computer
i was thinking th- that would pretty interesting because like me myself i would get tired of i 'd get tired of you know like the wires and plugging things in
and we take our computer also like on the road you know and put movies in it too
so and that gets awful
times where you get the wires to the to the cigarette lighter plug up things
but that that w- i wonder if that going to be taking over the regular ones eventually
oh okay
mhm
uh-huh
so we have
we have d. s. l. hookup for our internet
so
and i get a lot of s- e- i get a lot of like educational stuff for the kids off of there too
like their basic a. b. c.s and stuff
i 'll print off the computer too
because i do n't get anything else except for
and they have some interesting stuff on there
uh-huh
i know
mhm
you do n't have to go to library to look at a look to see if the book was there
just go on the internet to see if it 's there
and save you the time from going
mhm
i do a lot of surfing
mm
it 's vicky
oh really
i do n't catch too many vickys up
usually it 's victoria or something
no
i 'm here in indian- uh indianapolis
i 'm way on the kind of almo- on the other side of the map
uh it 's chilly
yesterday it was pretty warm
but her- mm mm you know it gets of- it 's off and on
it 's kind of chilly here at the moment
which i 'm kind of ready for the chilly weather myself
right around the end of august i am ready to hit the warm clothes
oh
houston 's not
yeah
i 've never been
never been
yeah
makes sense
it 's very liberal there
oh you should come up to seattle
man it 's like the liberal capital of the world
yeah
absolutely
s- all sorts of democratic type views and people out here
uh-huh
like we just passed um just passed an initiative that to make the smoking of marijuana and the possession of marijuana the least um like the like a police officer it 's there least priority is arresting people for things like that
yeah
it 's a pretty pretty laid back city
a lot of a lot of liberal ideas
a lot of vegetarians and people tha- people that hate george bush
yeah
mhm
right
yeah
yeah
i hear that
yeah
i hear that
yeah
absolutely
oh
yeah
i mean what do you have if you do n't have your family
you know
when times are kind a tough they are the people you look to to to kind of watch your back
and they 're going to be there for you no matter what
yeah
exactly
exactly
um i 'm a student right now
um i 've had all sort of jobs
i 've worked at ah in restaurants
and i 've w- um cook type positions
i 've done ah last two winters i 've actually worked at ski resorts which is a great job
you know it 's it 's um ca n't really beat that
you know you get out and snow board everyday and get paid for it
you know
before this i was in colorado
and i 've got some family out there
my i 've got a brother that still lives in colorado in crested butte
i do n't know if you are familiar with that at all
have you
small little corner of the world
you do n't see too many people actually a lot of people from from texas go out to crested butte
actually
that 's cool
i got some ah good friends in boulder which is kind of the front country out near breckenridge
yeah
i 've got people that are n't really my family
but i would consider to be my family
you know
that are kind of there for me no matter what
so i guess we got to kind of just keep talking until they tell us to stop
you just got to talk for ten minutes
it 's kind of weird
yeah
yeah
that 's unfortunate
unfortunate
yeah
i lived with my girlfriend
so i can understand where you 're coming from
like i 've gotten pretty tight with with ah her family
and they are kind a starting to consider me family and all that
and uh i do n't get along with her brother too well
um he 's kind of an asshole
but uh i guess that 's kind of understandable when you know some guy is dating dating you 're little you 're little sister
you know
uh-huh
so you were real close to them
um pretty laid back city where i live
houston is not so good
but
yeah
but often pretty often
that 's great
like it better than dallas
i mean houston is
yeah
very liberal out here
yeah
really
really
yeah
really
is that really
all vegetarians
yeah
yeah
they love people like that here too
it 's kind a weird to
yeah
he 's ah kind of from texas i guess somewhere
remember when his daughter got ah caught with uh well restaurants in austin drinking drinking alcohol you know stuff like that
so he did n't have uh the best family either i guess
but ah i do n't swing either way
you know does n't really matter to me
my parents are all kind of republican
but
you know i kind of stray from that especially after living here
you know what i mean
but uh family 's important though man because without them man going through a d. w. i. would really suck
yeah
mhm
yeah
no matter what of a dumb-ass decision you make
or
yeah
right
what 's happens kind of often
huh
for some reason
so what do you do
man
really
oh yeah
yeah
that 's cool
yeah
yeah
i 've been to crested butte
yes
yeah
they do
there
breckenridge
winterpark
and ah that 's i think that 's the only places i 've been
oh yeah
mm
yeah
oh sure
yeah
yeah
i was going to talk
yeah
yeah
family actually ah i was going to tell you about
yeah
i i i do n't really consider anybody family here
i mean except my couple of people
you know like i just broke up with my girlfriend
and man i was tight with her family for about a year and three months
man we had a we had a falling out
man and they hate me now
it really sucks because they were cool
that
yeah
i totally i totally thought i was like she was going to be the one
but man they hate me now
so
yeah
yeah
oh
man i wou-
right
yeah
her brother older brother man he loved me
and he was he ac- he 's actually younger than me
uh she 's six years younger than me
and ah he 's only a year younger than me though
but uh really i mean i used to go babysit thei- her little brother and sister all the time and play with them
and man i 'd alwa- i 'd be there everyday just about you know after work
i was really close to them
and man it just got cut off real quick
well it does n't really affect me much
and um i i can see where some people would be really upset about it
i mean it depends on what your your profession is and what you do
i think it it i do n't think really affects the the kind of normal everyday general type people
i think we might be talking about like the big power guys
you know or or power women
you know and um uh so like if you 're just a normal everyday kind of person i do n't think it really is such an issue working for that company directly where if you 're in one of those high power type of positions
that 's how i feel about that
you know
yeah
that 's sad
that 's sad because anybody that works for thirty or forty years and even say like the last ten or twenty years of their their j- career it 's a shame for that to happen
be- now that that would be something that would upset me
re- that would i would feel bad for people about that
you know but it 's the bigger guys that 's in these in these big corporations or even the women you know that are creating these problems
the c. e. o.s
the chairman of the board
and
sure
that 's right
it is
it is
that 's right
e well that 's right
you 're absolutely right to think like that because that 's what happens
and it 's always it 's always the underdog or the or the normal everyday business guy that goes to work and supports himself for a family that has the effects of what happens with these scandals and with these these uh guys that are in control of these big corporations
i think what happens is it goes to their head
and i think they realize well i do n't care
i 'm benif- benefiting everything from this company
so i do n't care what happens
you know and i mean it- it 's but i think that 's just a general consensus of people in the world nowadays
i just do n't think that there 's a whole lot of compassion for people period
you know it 's not like it used to be
i mean i 'm a guy in my forties
so i 'm from a little bit from the older school
not much past in the older school
but you know i 'm in my upper forties
so you know i know what it was like twenty years ago
and it 's not anything like that now
you know
and you cared about them
and they cared about you
and there was they always they tried to avoid that type of scandal
they wanted to satisfy their employee
now i do n't think it matters
i just think it 's just about who would cut whose head off first to get to the top
and that 's how i feel about that
you know
well you 're only a you 're a number
the-
that 's really bad
and do n't even offer a half-way decent package
you see if they offered you something good you figure oh you retire a little bit early
you get a part-time job
you might be able to manage
they 're just like tossing you out with like couple of w- what months of unemployment
and that 's it
maybe a little bit of what you had in your savings
and you 're done
you know
that 's horrible
see that does n't make sense to me
is n't that wild
or you 're gone too
i know
right
right
right
right
is n't that something
right
right
good for you
and that 's what you need to do
i think that 's what people need to do is they need to stand up for their right
and i think what happens is i i think that most companies nowadays know that the economy 's bad
no
yes
no
exactly
yeah
yes
right
right
like the the poor people in enron
they lost their retirement funds
that 's awful
yeah
yeah
right
exactly
right
exactly
especially the c. e. o.s
the c. e. o.s are were way out of line with all the stuff that they they get rewarded for for chopping heads
they get rewarded for making a lot of money while they they destroy the morale of the workers
and you know and then something like this where you 've put all that time into a company which is really rare nowadays
you know most people switch jobs every couple years nowadays
they do n't stick with one company for years and years
and the people were loyal enough to that company for all those years
and they figure okay
i can retire and not have to eat dog food
you know
yeah
yeah
right
right
no
no
right
no
no
i 'm probably about the same age as you
and and
yeah
it used to be that you went and worked for a company
and they valued you
yeah
right
yes
and
yeah
and working for a large company mm i worked for one several years ago
and it was horrible because that 's what they did
they would just
okay
we 're going
yeah
you 're a number
we 're going to downsize now
we 're going to throw everyone out of this company
i mean people had worked there for thirty years
and they they were like we 're sorry
you 're fired
goodbye
no
right
yeah
and
yeah
it was really a shame because they basically threatened these people
and they told them either you take this severance package or we do n't know what 's going to happen to you
and i watched them fire uh my boss who had been with the company for i b- like twenty-seven years
they fired him uh three days before christmas
and for no reason bec- only because he refused to take the severance package
and he was their highes- like one of their highest producers
and i was like i ca n't believe this
then they turned around and lied to the people who were under them and said either you take their place at much lower pay of course
right
or you 're gone
and that was a lie
so
yeah
i turned around and took the position figuring well i need the job one way or another
and i felt horrible about it because i thought here 's this poor guy
he taught me everything i know
i 'm taking his job
they 're paying me half of what they 're paying him
i know that from speaking with him
but i need the job badly
and then they turned around and appointed the same work i was doing they appointed someone to me to do the same type of work
and i said wait a minute
you told me that this was- position was gone
and i was making more money actually as the other person
you know they they cut my pay
so i was there for i 'd think about three months after that
and then i looked for another job and got up and i got one
yeah
yeah
m-
you know where are you from are you from the south
you are
hm
what
yes
ah yes
you do
and i and i i do too
i 'm sure
well that 's funny that we 've got two people from the south you know to ta-
have you ever done this before
great
can you do it t- more than three times
and that 's it huh
oh okay
well
it is
i 'm kind of nervous
well um what about martha stewart
that 's another corporate deal
i have n't either
but you know i 've been i- interested in you know what happened there
and oh what was the guy that ga- you know that 's just um gone to jail for that
you know that was involved with her in that
the um
ca n't think of his name
i saw something about him on t. v. the other night
they were interviewing him
and he was talking about ah how sorry he was
i think he got seven years
and you know they said um he said that you know he was sorry for what he had done
i guess so
i 'd be sorry too if i was going to jail for something like that
yeah
i know
it 's it 's really um terrible because i think it i- i think that it gives the wrong opinion to our youth and people that hear about these things
and and they think well you know these white collar guys are are doing you know lying and cheating and and embezzling money
doing all that stuff
and you know so if they 're doing like that why ca n't we do like that
so i ah you know i think that it sets a really bad example
it really does
so i do n't know how long we do they come on and tell you h- when you 're through talking or something
okay
well ah let 's see
martha stewart is one
and worldcom is one
and what 's another corporate scandal
it seems like there 's one other one that it 's been in the news lately
but of course um right off the tip of my tongue i ca n't think what it is
you know it 's some some big deal ah that 's been in the news lately
but you know some people say that all of this stems from you know that a lot of this um bad behavior and everything i do n't know if it does or not it does n't really seem like it would but that um president you know since clinton di- clinton because of of the way he acted uh you know a- all the unscrupulous things that went on while he was in office kind of um you know causes some of this other stuff
um you know everybody 's thinking well you know what the heck
i might as well do things
you know it does n't matter
you know the president did things he should n't have done
you know so
you know why should why should we be any bet- you know why why do n't we just do follow suit
i know
right
he sure was
he sure was
well i 'm ca n't think of i 'm trying to think of some other stuff to say
do you know anything else about the corporate stuff
yeah
you know um
i ca n't either
who is ke you remember ken lay
you know they talk about ken lay
i think he was with
was he with worldcom
or was he with that other company that i ca n't think of the name of that you know uh had all so much corporate scandal
i 'll tell you another one too
i just now thought of this is all the trouble that they had with the arthur anderson um
with the with the accounting firms
yeah
i 'm from i 'm from atlanta
yeah
that that i talk southern
th- that i talk like i 'm from the south
yeah
uh-huh
uh yeah
i 've done it before
yeah
uh-huh
uh two or two or three times i think
yeah
a couple of times
uh i think uh three ti- i think you can do it uh three times
uh-huh
yeah
eh uh uh this you first time calling
uh
no
you doing great
uh-huh
yeah
you doing great
yeah
that 's yeah about ye-
yeah
uh-huh
i i had n't heard anything about her on the news lately
ah
mm
uh yeah
i ca n't think of his name right off my hand
uh
yeah
he got yeah
yeah
he did
he got seven years i think
yeah
yeah
yeah
i would too
yeah
uh-huh
they uh they uh uh big time crooks and uh corporate people up there some some of them can be
uh-huh
right
yeah
right
exactly
yeah
exactly
yeah
right
yeah
right
that 's what i
yeah
sets a yeah
it does set a bad example
sure does
yeah
uh-huh
uh
uh yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh uh yeah
they come on and and let us know when we get through with the conversation
mhm
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
i ca n't think of it neither
uh-huh
right
yeah
right
right
exactly
yeah
yeah
he was
right
yeah
clinton he 's was ah he was ah ah what you call a character
i call him a character
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
ah no
i do n't uh know too much more about uh like you said about martha about martha stewart and that other other guy
i was trying to think of his name too
but i ca n't quite quite think of his name
uh yeah
yeah
oh yeah
uh-huh
yeah
ah yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
wha- what type of activities do you like to do outside
yeah
that sounds like fun
yeah
uh i i 'd i like to play basketball if i can if i f- fi- find the time
maybe with some friends
or uh you know like uh just go for a walk
gosh i think i i think that 's uh an underrated activity that people ar- peop- people are n't taking advant- advantage of anymore
ah
okay
oh
wow
tha- that takes some diligence
i
i was actually thinking about that today like about possibly like exercising indoors instead of outdoors because it might like i do n't know i might be able to do it since i 'm not avai- always able to just go out go go places
yeah
right
wow
yeah
i i wish i had that ability
i mean i 'm still pretty young
so i 'm alw- i 'm alw- i 'm always on the go doing stuff
so actually fin- finding the time to exercise is hard
oh cool
right
especially with like a a full day of work
or just you know
a lot of times i just want to go home and go to sleep
oh yeah
bally 's
yeah
wow
yeah
i used to go to a gym
and actually uh do do like an hour of bi- bicycling
and i never really liked it because there 's was n- i n- the only thing i co- i had the option of doing was listening to head- listening to headphones
i know like
yeah
if i could like have that choice of of uh either listening to music or watching t. v.
or
but uh i at the time when i did it i was n't in tune to actually audio books
i i like to listen to audio books when i 'm
yeah
i i like to do that in the car
but i also like to do it when i 'm ta- when i 'm talking a walk
especially
yeah
like like on a fall day i like to go take a walk and listen to an audio book
no ba-
basketball
i mean i it 's ab- it 's probably been a year since i 've played because i have n't had any time
but that 's probably my favorite outdoor sport or activity to do is just play and play like just shoot-around or play a play a pick-up game with my friends
um i would say in- inside activities like like actual physical ac- physical activities
i do n't know
probably nothing
well
now i am a a i i am a huge air hockey and uh um ah foosball
i love playing those games whenever i get the chance
or play play billiards
uh i just if i if i had more access to those i 'd probably play constantly
those are those are my
well if i if i were to go like a a like a pub or a bar or something and they have pool or darts or something like that
yeah
it 's definitely
yeah
um well when we 're on vacation i like to horseback ride
and i do play golf with my husband occasionally
and if we ever retire i will play more
and um that 's really about it i can think of
and what about you
i- g- see
well and see and i do that inside
i have i got a treadmill
and i do uh six miles a day
so
yes
it does
uh sometimes it 's very difficult to drag yourself
i do it at night
so it 's
well and the weather restricts you too because i used to walk outside with my daughter at six a. m. in the morning when she was in high school
and you know it the weather is just so unpredictable and can be so hot and sticky or cold and rainy
and
so i 've been doing mine inside for three-and-a-half years straight seven days a week
so and on days that i have happened to miss i i make it up on one of the other days and go longer on the treadmill
so well that 's that 's where i squeeze it in too though is that 's kind of my end of the day
i 'll put the uh wireless headphones on and watch uh an hour-and-a-half of you know t. v. programs
and just you know that 's how i fit it in because i tape all my programs so that you know i 'm doing it th- that time when i i get to watch two two-and-a-half hours in the hour and forty minute time frame because you do n't have the commercials
you just sift through the commercials
so but you 're right
i mean it it is difficult to do in
and that 's that 's the way i do it i because it
oh
oh yeah
definitely
i remember i remember when we were both working and um six a. m. in the morning you know we 'd be at the uh bally workout center
and it 's uh it 's a lot nicer having it in your house and having a little flexibility of you know if i get there a little bit later than i normally do
you know or sometimes you know if we go out and it 's twelve midnight i 'm on the treadmill at twelve midnight
so you ca n't do that when you 're you know restricted either outside or restricted going to a um a workout center
so
yeah
that 's not that does n't make the time go as fast as watching a t. v. program
yeah
we 've got some of those
we do th- those on vacation in the car
yeah
that 's nice
so so you p- you said did you say football
basketball
mm
well inside what kind of things do you do
so you do n't do board games
or or we do board games
we have air hockey table
you know i do the treadmill
watch movies
mhm
so there are things that could cause you to be indoors
you just do n't have access to them
right
but if if inside your home a- although i g- think inside they do n't necessarily mean in your home
they they could mean going out to say like a roller skating rink or something like that where you 're inside
um i think n- n- what i enjoy most of all is just walking around the city
i which i love doing
i-
do i row
oh oh oh um no
i hav- i have n't rowed since um
uh no
that 's sounds i would
eh i 'm not a big uh canoer rower
um no
i do n't know
horseback riding i enjoy
ice skating
um a-
roll- um love to
i have n't really i
mhm
w- what are you um what is your best activity outside
mhm
oh really
oh
well you really are active
mhm
good for you
wher- do you live in in los angeles
mhm
so walking is not a big activity
right
right
right
mhm
oh
i live in the city proper
so wh- j-
oh
uh-huh
which which i 'm sure is lovely
really
oh
that 's fabulous
hm
i mean i to me there 's nothing like just w- walking around the city
a- and and it never ceases to amaze me
um
yes
there is a significant other
unfortunately he 's now in florida which which is just weird
but
yes
that 's a very long walk
but um no
actually the city is extremely safe
i never feel uncomfortable walking around
never
um and it 's it 's j- to me it 's just you know window shopping just looking at architecture
it 's so i think it 's so stimulating
yeah
mhm
yeah
which one
oh as
right
right
um fortunately i did miss the um blackout in the city
um well i 'm originally from baltimore
but um
oh really
right
right
exactly
that 's funny
not not that many people even remember mccormick 's
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
now that i do n't that 's
and
yeah
i- it 's it 's an interesting city
there
eh i mean it 's
yeah
i do n't you know i- i i ca n't think of anything really that
i mean i re- today i was just i was just walking down through um soho
and um it amazes me that that this even if you think that you know you know if you walked around the city that i mean you can wal- i can stumble onto a block that i 'm totally unfamiliar with
even around my neighborhood
which this is really weird i had discovered streets that i 've never walked down before
um i live near um do you know where stuyvesant
um so it 's down a-
not
exactly
exactly
but i mean i discovered avenues um like beyond a. b. and c.
when you sort of beyond those
and i was like oh my god
i 've never walked down these streets before
hm
do you do you row
yeah
i remember i used to go rowing in prospect park in the lake
or in in central park
oh
the
how about tennis
really
well that 's wonderful
yeah
that 's a wond-
oh
that 's great
how about roller skating
that i miss
i miss ice skating because in new york you used to go up to the sky rink or down at rockefeller center and ice skate
there 's very few places out here in california to do that
well i uh like tennis
i like uh archery
yes
and uh i l- and of course jogging
i get up uh i go to the gym at five o'clock every morning
in los angeles
yeah
well
yeah
th- but th- but i have to do it on the treadmill because everything is so far from one another here
and it 's you know but what i used to do is ah i used to jog around a ah baseball diamond about a and uh jog and then walk you know intermittently
and then i got a heel spur because i went from soft pave to hard pave
so i had to curtail that for a while
but then that that 's gone
so w- you live in the city proper
oh wonderful
i used to live in brooklyn heights
and i as a matter of fact i used to y- i had a a club that met every morning at six o'clock
we used to run the promenade in brooklyn heights and then over the over the brooklyn bridge
yeah
uh so i i do miss new york
i really do
well it 's a little dangerous to do by yourself
eh i mean eh do you have family
or is there a significant other
oh
okay
he took a long walk
well that 's great
well that 's wonderful
yeah
that 's that 's absolutely the kind of stuff that i love also
that 's that 's what 's missing here in california because i mean you walk uh ah i my office used to be on uh sixtieth street between lex and park
and ah i used to walk all over the place
and as a matter of fact during the blackout in new york i walked uh nineteen sixty-five i walked from
my office then was on lexington avenue and thirtieth street
i walked over the brooklyn bridge from there to over the brooklyn bridge because there was nothing nothing running or working
well that 's good
w- where are you originally from
oh are you
oh i love baltimore
i spent some time down there too
yeah
as a matter of fact i remember ah when the day was right and the wind was right ah mccormick 's whatever they were doing that day
eh
oh
sure
as a matter of fact uh i remember the the mechanic 's theater
i do n't know if that 's still there
i stayed at the lincoln hotel right across the street from the mechanic 's as a matter of fact
and uh i remember the harbor front and little italy in baltimore
oh yeah
very memorable
but there 's no city like new york for walking
new york is a walking town
out here i mean they park close so they do n't have to walk
whi- which area which area do you live in
oh sure
sure
oh sure
that 's not far from beth israel hospital on second ave
yeah
i know where that
yeah
sure
oh sure
well but they see i want to tell you something
beyond a. b. and c.
how is it with you
uh-huh
how old are you
you 're twenty-two
so you 're you 're you 've been out of high school for like four years or so
three four years
yeah
do you go to school
oh there you go
see that 's another thing too
if you 're married you almost have to um be part of uh an organization or like a church or something
i know we went when i was married i 'm not m- married anymore
i 'm divorced
but when i was married we used to go to church every sunday
and they would after the services they woul- we would have uh you know little cookies and cakes and food
and we 'd sit with the pastor and different people and talk for like a half hour
and there 's a there 's one way to to meet people when you 're married
and another reason i guess probably in your case and in th- in the case of my my brother who is also married um they have neighbors stop by all the time
especially if you have a hou- d- do you live in a house or an apartment
an apartment
see if you have a house its like the gathering place because i 've noticed that too
a lot of neighbors would stop by
and people come by
but in a in an apartment it 's a little more difficult i think
oh yeah
mhm
yeah
wow
what were you guys uh doing in san anto- did you move because uh because of someone had a job there in san antonio
oh yeah
my sister lives in in houston
is that where you 're you 're at
you 're in houston
yeah
yeah
she lives in houston in uh in an area i think you s- i think it 's called friendswood
i do n't know what kind of suburb
i know it 's a suburb of houston
friendswood texas
and her husband actually they 're in the middle of splitting up right now
but um he works for nasa
he 's a nasa engineer
so that 's the reason
they they were from like th- the midwest
and they both moved down ther- down t- to texas after after college because he got a job with nasa which is like one of the best jobs you could have i guess liv- working in texas unless you work for one of the oil unless you 're an executive for an oil company or something
but
yeah
sh- i even with her when i talk to her she she has only like a handful of friends from work
but i guess it takes time you know to accumulate
hm did he get him work wh- where he works
right
right
here 's the key
um his fiancee are you friends just because of the close proximity or or do you take or is there like common interest that you guys share
right
so you guys would be f- you 'd be friends even if your even if your um if the guys did n't in- did n't introduce you
oh
see that 's pretty cool
yeah
because my ex-wife we we we neither of us really has a i was part of a music project
so i moved out to california with a bunch of people that are par- that were part of a band you know part of a like a a like a partnership a music partnership
and those were our fr- that was our family and friends just that circle of like with- within ten people
and uh and as we dis- as it slowly disintegrated over the years uh ah i know i never really reached out to anybody besides that inner circle besides just a few people that lived in the neighbor-
we used to rent a house in a nice area in woodland hills
and some of the people that lived in houses next to us i 'm still friends with them
i call them every once in a while even though i do n't live there anymore
but um she had found she worked for j. b. l. speaker company
and she found like a c- and usually when people work for big corporations they uh they get together you know company gatherings
and um and that 's how she met a couple of pretty good friends
and i think up to right now it 's been like five six years ago she 's still very good friends with this one lady that that she met just through a casual work acquaintance
and that 's happened to me too
but i have n't really latched on to anybody
like i i have some people 's phone numbers
and when i 'm working when i 'm looking for work i usually contact them you know for networking
and that 's about it
um i do n't know how it is in texas
i know in california i 've had a difficult time making ends meet and having money
i mean it 's a grea- california 's a great place to live if you have money
right
well um i 've never really had many friends at all
um i 'm twenty-two
yeah
uh no
i 'm married
and i have uh two daughters
yeah
oh
oh
yeah
yeah
an apartment
yeah
yeah
al-
yeah
also i 've lived in a lot of different places
um i grew up in florida
and then we moved to um midland texas because my dad w- was working here in texas for a oil company
and then um when um my mom passed away um i kind of got real depressed
and then i moved back to florida with a friend
and um i met my husband there
and then um we were together for maybe two years
and we got married
and um we moved to san antonio
and then we moved back to midland
and then back to college station
and then now we 're here
we 're here in houston now
so
yeah
h- he yeah
he got a promotion to move there
yeah
okay
heard of that
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
that 's that 's great
right
yeah
i have
yeah
um my husband had a friend
and um since he got a promotion down here he talked his friend into coming down here and becoming a manager too
yeah
so they 're working together now
and um i 'm friends with his fiancee right now
so
right now i only have like one friend
and before then when i lived in midland i only had one friend
and uh i mean i knew plenty of people but one really good friend
well um we 've both done the same kind of work before
and um we like going looking at different place- like different shops and stuff
and um
so we 've been out a couple times
right
yeah
right
right
right
right
right
yeah
mm no
i think it 's better to live longer
what do you think
but
uh-huh
okay
all right
gossiping
well it 's just you know people who have nothing better to do than than to gossi-
like i 've been the victim of gossip before
and it 's just you know i mean when sometimes when you have nothing better to do then you gossip
and that 's a way of you know makin- making yourself feel like you 're better than someone else you know what i mean because they did so and so and such and such thing
and can you believe that
and you would never do that
even though you 're probably a hypocrite most of the time when you gossip
you know but what do you think
have you ever been the victim of gossip
mhm
uh-huh
uh-huh
you know it just makes a pers- i just think it makes a person feel really awful
you know mhm
uh-huh
mhm
so but have you d- ha- do you have you done all of those other things on the list
i mean
mhm
mhm
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
that 's true
i mean but unless you you buy them cheaply like on the internet
mm
yeah
i mm that 's true
but then i mean people spend their money on so many differen- i mean some people waste money on clothes
or some people waste money on you know going out
i mean if you think about it drinking costs more than than smoking in- i mean at least in in new york
you know what i mean
do you g-
i mean
mhm
well no
no
i 'm just saying in terms of cost though
you know what i mean
mhm
yeah
yeah
but it 's like some people go out and they can spend sixty dollars in a night on drinking
whereas if you 're if you 're smoking cigarettes and you get them on the intern et for two dollars a pack then that 's like fifteen bucks
you know what i mean
mhm
well how much do you spend a week on on drinking
mhm
oh
that 's not bad
mhm
mhm
wait what college do you go to by the way
really
in champagne
oh
wow
that 's cool
what
no
i graduated from college
i uh i went to oberlin
yeah
it 's in ohio
yeah
yeah
but um so anyways i guess we 're off topic again
um um what were the other things on the list
oh
yeah
overeating
see you know what i heard about um overeating is that or or just in general like you know obesity and everything is that um right now smoking is the number one cause of death in the country
but then pretty soon it 's going at- um switch over to obesity
mhm
because
yeah
mhm
but is it better to die young or to live longer
see if you 're just going to sit in a chair when you 're older and like wear the pants and sit around i do n't know if that 's really living
but yet we 're getting off topic
i think we 're supposed to stay on topic here
i do n't know
like gossiping
what makes that the worst
yeah
exactly
uh-huh
i don-
yeah
like i just think it 's dumb
like it depends you know because my gossip was somebody thought that i stole this thing
and i really did n't
and like everybody just made stereotypes of me of being like a thief whenever and like a pervert because i st- they s- they thought i stole these pictures
but then they found them later
and it was like
yeah
it is terrible
it 's like
yeah
it does
and yeah
probably worse than any of those other things
you 're right
it 's mentally well if you 're like damaged mentally then it affects you physically too probably
it goes all around
um i do n't really overeat that much
but i exercise all th- i exercise fairly often
and i drink
i th- i do n't smoke cigarettes
cigarettes are bad
but i know a lot of friends most of all my friends smoke cigarettes
and like i 've learned from them
it 's way too ex- it 's very expensive
and it 's not worth like the cost
definitely
even then they 're not that cheap like fifteen dollars for like a carton
sure
it 's cheaper than the store
but yet it 's still paying fifteen dollars a carton
and i- what are they really doing
like not much
you know
it- to an extent
i think i get i get more out of drinking than i do out of smoking
in terms of cost i i i do n't drink like every day
i only drink like once a week i m- if that
maybe even once every two weeks
right
true
but then it also depends on how much you drink and how much you smoke
and i i do n't know
uh i 'm in college
so like my drinking is pretty cheap
maybe like five bucks a week
yeah
it 's pretty cheap
university of illinois
yeah
in champagne
what about you
yeah
and you live in new york
interesting
yeah
yeah
i 've i 've heard about that too
yeah
it 's like i do n't even remember
there was some statistic like fifty percent of all americans are obese
something crazy like that
it was i do n't know
it was some yo- i do n't know where they get that from
but they always say stuff like that
continue
where i got to smell it or something like that
then that would be a very annoying type of thing
yeah
so what i i i have a roommate
so what i do is she smokes out on the patio uh and and cl- and closes the closes the patio door
which is nice of her
but it 's just
it 's just weird because well i would just it 's just like if you do n't smoke then you know it 's just that uh
it 's this last year in new york well because i go back to new york
like usually half a year half the year i 'm back there
and they just stopped what we 've had here for several years
no smoking in in restaurants because that was always weird back there
you 'd be eating breakfast something like that and having a nice dinner
and there would be smoke waffing through you
and here you do n't have that anymore
and back there was like a big to do
you know like they 're going to lose money
you 're right
you 're right
i mean an- an- and finally peop- and finally uh you know people did n't go out of business
and nothing happened
the earth did n't fall
it just
right
right
yeah
well a lot of my my my friends are on the program
and uh i do i 'm mild about it
you know i mean i i do
but at mo- but i have friends on the program
and and i used to be a musician
and i used to hate playing in bars where people were drunk and hitting on women not listening to the music
that type thing
yeah
and uh i so i do n't know
i mean i do-
i 'm not quite sure um as i said what what they 're looking for
and i guess i- th- be cut it down to the chase the biggest pain in the ass is somebody who who 's a drunk and who smokes
and uh
yeah
i mean everybody kind of does that
i work in the film industry
and uh i mean on the sets that 's just like that 's what makes the time go by
i mean you know
yeah
it 's
it 's like am watching the baseball game now
and you know i i you know there 's there 's a jennifer and uh and ben
you know what i mean
so so there 's
yes
yeah i sometimes so and uh
yeah
i do too
i do too
well i 'm
it 's it 's well we do n't know how old you are but i 'm i 'm sixty
i just turned sixty
and it
you 're kidding
but the thing is you know when you hit when you hit like fifty the metabolism stopped
and i and i walk two three miles a day
and you just ca n't i and you just ca n't eat at all
you know at all and ju- uh you know it 's just that well i mean i- i- it 's l- i- you mean the metab- my metabolism is zero
so uh i try to exercise in other words by walking
and and that 's one of my i walk everyday
but still i do n't lose any weight hardly you know
so it 's just uh
and i 'm not and as much as i would like to exercise more it 's just it 's very i find it very difficult
i 've i 've always have found it difficult to get uh what 's the word am looking for disciplined
right
okay
right
right
yeah
that 's what it is
that 's exactly it
that 's why i hitch i usually walk to toluca lake every morning
that way at least you 're seeing some scenery and some people walking by or cars walking by and something
yeah
oh
it it 's eighty degrees today
it 's like man this year this is really holding on
yeah
yeah
yeah
i 'm an ex-smoker
and it 's cruel
mhm
yeah
right
right
well it was a big to do here when we cut it out
yeah
well i agree with you
i think i i i really do n't like the smell of tobacco anymore
just the same way as i do n't drink alcohol anymore
just the same way as i do n't um like the smell of stale beer or scotch or you know stuff like
yeah
pretty insulting when you come to think of it
yeah
uh that 's uh that 's pretty uh pretty good
i do n't know
gossiping
i ca n't object to that too much
i do it all the time
yeah
oh
you do
that 's the lifeblood of the entertainment industry
yeah
yeah
i know i that i mean i it can be very destructive on the other hand
i 've kind of felt that most of the people who have the destructive gossip about them deserve it
so
yeah
but i it 's a i ca n't being overweight i have a problem with
because i have been overweight
and i still need to lose more pounds
and so
eee you do n't sound like it
i 'm seventy
no
w- what do you mean
i do- i do n't
uh-huh
yeah
oh
i see what you mean
yeah
well it 's time consuming
i i never i never had really a problem with my weight until i was about forty five i guess
and uh then i had never of course in my life except for sports that i played over the years not much uh i had never been to a gym to workout or uh used a treadmill or anything
and then i got type two diabetes
and uh the doctor basically told me you know i said well these medications are a pain in the ass you know
let 's get rid of them
and he said well lose weight
exercise
so i had to start going to the gym
which i 'm p- i 'm pretty good about going to the gym three times a week
but the treadmill
it 's easier to first for me to somehow as you say to be undisciplined about that
i still try to do it on the off days
but it 's more difficult for me to
and it 's so boring
god
yeah
well i do n't know
i ca n't do that in the summers
it 's too damned hot here
yeah
that 's absurd
i use to live in the hollywood hills
and it was n't too bad there
except the hills were hell
but when i lived back east for many many years
and i could uh ride a bike along the b. and o. canal in washington
yeah
i feel that would
wow
did you did you find anything
cool
cool
that 's good
yeah
actually
yeah
my sister was in uh budapest a couple years ago for thanksgiving
and
yeah
all the th- y- st- studying abroad
yeah
and like uh
yeah
i heard all the other american students they they cooked their own version of a turkey
so it tasted pretty funky
but
yeah
but it was
no
um just
yeah
i guess just family and stuff
um you know either christmas or thanksgiving is uh you know the one where the fa- my family would travel to uh grandparents
you know
right
so that 's like maybe you know one or two times out of the year that 's the only time i get to see them
so so
yeah
it 's a good it 's a good opportunity to go see them
um i do n't really you know i do n't care too much about the gift giving part of it because i uh whatever i do n't really expect much
you know
yeah
yeah
definitely
yeah
true
oh
oh
th- they do the six months of daylight and six months of darkness
or
yeah
yup
right
right
wow
y-
right
yeah
picture ice all the way around
but over there
um christmas maybe
i know uh thanksgiving um my family 's actually all coming to me
so the
yeah
so i 'm pretty i 'm pretty psyched for that
i live in you know i live in new york city
and uh i just moved here this year
and so everyone else is all from live in new england the you know northern new england
and so uh you know they 're excited to come down and spend the big apple in thank- i mean for thanksgiving
come down here
so
i do actually
yeah
it is
it is
yeah
you know i wou- what i mean if had a little
yeah
a little studio place then i would n't you know certainly not do that
but but no
i i live in uh i have a whole house
so wi- i live with five other guys in a big house so tons of room
yeah
yeah
and ev- you know e-
yeah
and everyone else you know probably is going back to their families for thanksgiving
so we have plenty of room here for me
but
yeah
uh i-
yeah
i 'll do the eating i think
i don- i do n't really cook at all
oh
that 's true
yeah
i 'd probably
oh
yeah
i 'll just
yeah
i do n't know what to do really
i 'll provide the kitchen let people people do
i wo n't do it
have it
yeah
have a thanksgiving catered
yeah
yeah
i g-
yeah
i guess i guess they would
yeah
do n't have a big kitchen or anything
yeah
bu-
yeah
it 'll be a it 'll be a good time
uh christmas i do n't know
maybe uh because my grandparents do n't live too far
they live in connecticut
so uh maybe we just go there
like we do last year
but
yeah
we 'll see
yes
oh that was that was a movie
yeah
yep
yep
there we go
yay
just like the
yup
oh really
alright
alright
sounds good
cool
yeah
uh let 's see i do n't know about making up a holiday
i think america has too many holidays anyway
it was interesting
did i did
a bunch a bunch of americans were um we were pretty focused on finding a place to have turkey and just sit down
which was which was nice
i i i bet i bet they were n't as big as they are here
why is christmas uh one of your favorites
mhm
ah nice
mhm
no
i think people being present is the most important
i have a brother who lives in anchorage alaska
and uh i just mm bu- i 've gone up to visit uh a couple of times in the summer
and i 'm going go visit this christmas holiday because um i 've never been there in the winter
and it i just want to see them
and i 'm very curious if it 's going to be completely dark
almost
yeah
it 's kind of like um you know i guess like finland sweden
it 's on the same latitude i think
and it 's very light all summer long
yeah
it 'd be interesting i think
uh i th- it 's not as cold as people th- think
n- j- yeah
so will you travel this christmas holiday
oh
mhm
do you have enough uh room for them to sit and eat turkey
that 's key
good
good
that 's good
now will you d- will you do all the cooking
or will people pitch in
that 's uh you may find it different if you 're hosting though
i 've never hosted a thanksgiving
hm
well i 'd imagine in new york too i 'm i 'm sure people call up and order stuff all the time
i mean i mean i 'm sure they go to the grocery store and cook at home
but i i always imagined in the city that people just a a lot of the stuff they 'll just deliver it
mhm
definitely
that 's nice
they made some movie christmas in connecticut
i do n't know if it was
i don- i do n't know who was in it
but it was uh it 's good
it 's an old black and white film
maybe maybe you can ha maybe you can rent it when you go see your grandparents
that 's right
it is
it 's uh well it 's also supposed to be very farmer 's almanac says it 's supposed to be a very cold winter
so there 'll probably be plenty of snow and very much a a new england a true new england winter
mhm
i i do too
i always thought th- half that the stuff was made up
because uh
mhm
mhm
yeah
well with with children
yeah
it it is because you 've got the easter egg hunt
and if you 're associated with any denom- denomination or if you went to church then you know there would be gatherings there
and then gatherings with family and everything
right
right
exactly
an- and so do i
i 'm i 'm also catholic
and and i associate with that too
um but it 's also with nature itself because you know it 's
yeah
um so an- and that 's i i love that
i love that
after after everything 's been dead and we 've celebrated winter and everything
and then all of a sudden life comes back
and
well
yeah
it is
it 's a very nice season
so
mhm
yeah
oh yes
yeah
no
i mean that would be a very good holiday to to celebrate
um well then of course they have these unofficial holidays
like grandparents day
and you know
mm
mhm
oh yeah
exactly
that 's very true
mhm
mm
mhm
mm
m- yeah
nope
what is it
oh
i see
yeah
yeah
mm
well
hm
well here in boston we i live in boston and we have this thing called bunker hill day
and that was when bunk uh the the battle of bunker hill
yeah
but it 's only celebrated here in this county in suffolk
yeah
it 's a very mu- and so of course is the government of course the the government workers are off
and the schools are closed
but everyone else has to work because it 's such a minor holiday
and n- n- unless you are from boston
which i 'm not
but if you 're from boston and you were raised here everyone knows about it
but if you 're a transplant then you know you have to learn about it
so
i know
yeah
it 's it 's interesting that you say easter because i r- i remember as a as a child i used to really really like easter
and i 've i do n't know i i guess as the kids were younger and growing up uh really liked it
an- and now easter has kind of
yeah
i i would n't say it 's fallen into the background
but
yeah
it it does n't seem to be quite as quite as big a holiday as it as it was uh years ago
mhm
right
and and i do
uh i i guess when i think of easter i think of uh easter vigil because i we attend the catholic church
and i usually do that
but it 's i do n't really associate it with the holiday
i associate it with a religious event which is
a it 's
mhm
if we have
very much so
mhm
celebrating winter
that 's an interesting way to put it
i oh i i find that very interesting because it 's uh
eh eh
yeah
you we really should celebrate winter
winter 's a nice season too
but creating a holiday
gee i don- i do n't know
i if i were going to create a holiday i think i 'd create a holiday that was kind of of national celebrate having kids day
just sort of a sort of a holiday that families could be together
an- and uh
you know
eh celebrate the ti- i 'm i 'm gettin- i 'm somewhat nostalgic about that i guess
our our son our daughter 's been gone for a couple of years off to college
and our son went away this year
so w- we 're empty nesters uh for the first time
and we 're glad to be
but it uh it is different
you know those things irritate me
because i- i i they probably should n't i guess
but so much has been commercialized about so many things
and here all of a sudden you have organizations trying to pass things off as holidays to celebrate
and what they really are is an excuse to sell you more greeting cards or or candy or what have you
i know i my wife is from detroit
and when i when i first moved up there i found it very curious that they celebrate something in detroit called or in in that area part of the country called sweetest day
and i had never heard of sweetest day before
and she was just amazed
oh you have n't heard of sweetest day
i mean that 's a big a big holiday
and i said well i 've lived uh a number of different places
and i 've i 've never heard of it
had you ever heard of it
there you go
uh it 's an excuse for the candy manufacturers and the card manufacturers to sell candy and cards to people in michigan
i mean you- y- people take out ads in the paper
and they they it it 's just this big deal
it 's sometime in october
and um
yeah
it just becomes a little bit uh i do n't know
it it it kind of spoils the whole concept of holidays for me to see things like that happen
i will tell her when i get off the phone
one of the firs- one of the first things i 'm going to do is say bill has never heard of sweetest day either
oh sure
yeah
right
well but that 's okay
i mean you you it it 's a local celebration
that that 's fine
right
right
everybody looks at you like whoa wait a minute
wh- why are n't you why are n't you looking forward to bunker hill day
yeah but that 's uh
mm and why
either that or more suicides
no
i 'm just kidding
mm
i think i like thanksgiving
well s- for similar reasons plus the food and the family
of course christmas has those presents
well okay
then so that would be th- you like christmas and your birthday
no
oh you do
uh-huh
like you go out
so are you really you 're in l. a.
you know i think christmas would um if i could go like some place like new york or where it snows at christmas that would really be cool though
yeah
i lived there for about a year
and then i lived in ottawa too for five years
yeah
and colorado in in high school
but yeah
just the fireplace going
you know and the snow outside
and my son
when he was three i took him back to colorado eh w- at my parents his grandparents for christmas
and i was into photography then
and you know what i did
there was a christmas ball on the christmas tree at my grand- at my dad 's house
and i took a picture of my son 's face in the ball on the tree
that 's kind of cool huh
he is about three
well three oh
no he 's about thirty
what do you think i meant
are you married
you have kids
no i 'm not
me too
one boy
what do you have
how old is he
oh
that 's such a good time
y- y- you enjoy yourself
i loved it when i had my son
it was- it 's just me and him
i did do you wo- do you work full-time
oh
you do n't
so you 're there
that 's cool
so um i do n't know what else you 're supposed to- what else did she say
take our favorite holiday and do what
oh
you know eh i- i 'm just well it- also its when i had when my son was little it was it was more fun
kids
eh you know that 's the whole trip
did you do the thing we used to do when i was little
we put cookies out for santa and write a note
well my son did the same
and i still have that note today
its so cute
yeah
well he was so little he could n't write
so he just told me what he wanted
and he goes and and p. s. eh oh he says um there 's cookies for you santa and water for the reindeer
p. s.
let rudolph drink first
is n't that cute
oh
yeah
i keep all his stuff
i loved that
when i when he was little i would tell him i 'd rather he would make me something or write a card than get to buy it or pick flowers out of the you know anything like that
and he would um so he just did that his whole life
he he wrote me the the greatest cards all through
i just had beautiful cards on mother 's day that he would just write out of his own head
yeah
that 's pretty cool
huh
he lives in um west l. a.
well he runs an antique store on sunset um boulevard
and actually lives in beverly hills at the moment with his bosses
but that 's not saying that he could afford to live there
but they let him stay in one of their
so yeah
so where where are you
well what do you during um during the day
uh how did you find this this
um i was surprised i ran across this this phone thing
well i think i was just doing one of those things where i do i opened my i get paid e-mails
you know and i and i ended up you know how you 'll go on one site with it and there 's something interests you and you go there
and i do n't exactly know oh i do surveys also
and somehow i ended up where it said you want to i saw ten dollars and a phone call
and i started reading it
and i thought yeah
because that 's like the e-mails pay what
from anywhere from a penny to penny to five cents is th- is the most
so ten dollars i 'm thinking mm
but it interests me because it 's it was about communicating and phone calls
and i so i just thought what the heck
and i actually got a call
i think i got a call the other night too but i was sleeping
i was real sick
and heard on my answering machine i went oh no
will they call me back
oh really
oh
she did she tell you about it
do you have a computer
oh
so you were lucky that she told you
well because i like
i do n't know
just seem that when christmas come around it seems like everybody is more happier and you know things are fresher
yeah
and then i get broke as i do n't know what
but other than that i like i like christmas because all the family get together
really
yeah
that 's right
that 's the best thing
yeah
my birthday too
i party up on my birthday though
mhm
yeah
i got out and with my friends and you know just hang out or whatever
yeah
i 'm in l. a.
mhm
uh-huh
right
yeah
that it- one year we went to big bear for christmas
and it was beautiful
oh really
okay
right
right
uh-huh
okay
uh-huh
what
uh-huh
oh
that was nice huh
yeah
okay
how old is he now
oh
oh okay
no
you
yeah
i have w- i have one
a boy
six
yeah
yeah
right
n- no
no
yeah
mhm
and tell how you would celebrate it and what do you like about it
right
so i guess that 's probably why i 'm so into it now
you know
santa
yeah
uh-huh
really
have you ever showed it to him
uh-huh
oh
that was cute
have you showed that to him since he 's been grown
oh
that 's cool
uh-huh
right
yeah
ri-
that 's nice
so does he live here too
in california
oh okay
uh-huh
oh okay
i know
that 's right
that 's cool
um during the day
um practically here when i 'm not
sometimes i volunteer at the school
at my at my son 's school
but most of the time i 'm here or
uh-huh
how did you find it
uh-huh
right
oh okay
i know that
oh really
right
yeah
that was
uh-huh
yeah
my one of my friends
he had she was doing it
and she was like girl you need to call and just see you know how it goes
so
yeah
no
i do n't
yeah
she told me
no
at least eight bucks
i not going to say
eh i know it would be going uh asking for a little too much
but eight bucks you know
or jus- or just pay your eigh- or just give them a hundred dollars a day for working
i mean eight dollars you can get eight in eight hours you have sixty-four dollars
so i guess it would be asking a little bit too much for a hundred dollars a day
yeah
i mean uh you 're going to be talking about people here now that have no education
so
no
mhm
same here
yeah
yeah
ah
was there a second part to this question
okay
oh
i still i still lost
you know it 's unheard of
there 's no way i could make it on five fifteen
they are going to have to better than that now
come on
the nerve that they would even offer me five fifteen an hour
excuse me
excuse me
you have you have to just stay on the phone ten minutes
like if th- if you hang up before the robot operator comes back and there 's no one there then you 're probably your call is disqualified
yes
i have
oh i have done it with another company
yeah
uh no
i have done at least four
but no
you you cut short eh when uh when he comes back eh and no one 's on the line
then uh you wasted your time
yeah
uh ten minutes is n't a long time
but sometimes it is when you answer when you are done with the question in five seconds
you know
uh w- you are only allowed one call a day
um um i think it 's my second
may- it might be my third
i 'm not sure
they called me yesterday
but i was n't available yesterday
there was a mess- they left me a message
but uh i did n't take it
i took it today
but i thought i thought it was going to be over the end of uh september
and ah they extended it another month
i thought the survey was over with
but they extended it a month
right
or
yeah
i think eight bucks is the minimum that you can survive on
right
yeah
that 's not bad either
right
right
it also depends on the nature of your job too i mean because i think that anybody that is a hard worker can make i think at least a hundred dollars a day
you know um but five fifteen an hour
god it was only like i mean when i was young it was only like four seventy-five an hour four fifty an hour or something like that
so it really has n't gone up that much in ten years
um eh um just how we settle at the rate of five fifteen
you know i think it was just that
i do n't remember the rest of it
um
whatever
it 's terrible
but i mean i guess
um now do they base your pay on what you talk about
do they base like this like on on what you talk about
meaning like if if you did n't if you wasted the entire time not talking about it would they
oh okay
um what else was i going to ask you
and you 've done this before
um and have you done it more than three times because they say you can only do it three times
oh you have
oh really
oh
this is the first time i 've heard of this
right
right
yeah
well it was a small it was a short question
but now i have a another question
is this they say you can call up to three times
but is it for the same study
like or do you have to wait a different day
one a day
and so this is your first second or third call
right
oh so they called you huh
got you
i 'll call you back
i 'm sorry what
i 'm sorry wh-
really
hm
oh
yeah see
i i am on the other end
i would i think that i would n't commit perjury
um unless it was n't it depends on what it was
if it was something you know major i would n't lie for anyone for anything
only because i 'm i uh based on my religious beliefs i would n't do it
right
but i i it i guess i could n't really say because i even just lying for someone if i know that i 'm lying if i 'm taking the actual initiative and lying about something i i do n't that 's a sin to me
so i do n't consider that something i would do
now being put in a situation obviously that would be a little bit different because i ca n't really say
i 'm not in the situation
but
right
right
yeah
yeah
because i 'm not well i 'm not i 'm not good at lying anyway
but i 'm not too like i 'm not even big on things like when like if my mom lies in like a stupid lie
like she tells somebody oh i did n't tell you know my daughter about our conversation
but she really did talk to me about it
that kind of makes me feel weird
i would n't say anything to the person
but it makes me feel weird
it makes me feel like she 's not setting a good example
and she 's not you know how many times has she done that to me then
you know how many times has she lied to me and then said you know said she did n't tell someone something when she did
um but as far as the court system goes i do n't know i would be i still think i would be afraid but to of getting caught also
you know
who 's in on it
sounds like a scam
yeah
right
see that 's actually happened to me before
now that i 'm thinking about it
yeah
my friend um my friend melissa caught her boyfriend cheating on her or whatever and decided to key his car
and i told her not to
i was like you 're out of your mind
and he figured it out that it was her
so he was taking her to small claims court
and she wanted me to lie saying that she had keyed his car i do n't know why she wanted me to say this in front of his house when she had actually done it at school at college
and i i did n't end up going for her at all
i did n't so that i did n't have to worry about what i was going to say
i told her i did n't think it was appropriate for me to lie
and i even though i wanted to help her out wa- i do n't know why it would make a difference where she keyed the car
but i did n't end up going because i felt like number one i did n't- i did n't want to get in trouble for it
and number two i did n't think it was fair that she was dragging me into something when i had warned her not even to do it in the first place
you know
so i guess that kind of answers my question then
i guess i do n't think i would lie about it
oh
my gosh
that 's really dramatic
r- right
i guess being in the situation depending on what it is because i do n't when i hear the word perjury you know i- it makes me think of lying in court
when someone did something bad you know what i mean to cover it up
so and it could be
right
yeah
and also also the other person not like even its like you know i mean because people commit crimes all the time
and they 're somebody 's brother or sister or dad or mom or daughter
you know so obviously they 're related to them
i mean how do their family members feel
are they going to lie for their dad who made me you know kill the next door neighbor or something just to keep him out of jail
or do you know what i mean
when when is there
yeah
that 's what i 'm saying
like when is there a line
like where you 're okay
well now it 's too it 's too big of a risk
and it 's too you know i would think that all lying would be or all perjury would be a line to cross that i would n't want to cross
course i 'm not in that situation
i ca n't say one hundred percent
kind of a loading me upward
yeah
that 's why i did
that 's why with my friend melissa i completely was like you know i 'm not even going to go with you to court because i do n't want to be put in that position
and i was like if you want to go ahead and lie you know on the stand that 's your deal
but i 'm not going to be there
right
well yeah
i mean that kind of goes along with the you know as eh as long as in the end it does n't hurt anybody
um
right
and then and then again you know sometimes lying is n't really lying
it 's more so bending the truth or leaving out information
um
but yeah
all in all i think i would have to say it depends on the situation
you know
right
right
yeah
mhm
yeah
then i mean then again um and the- uh aga- it 's all based on who who knows
who 's in on it
um n- not to make not to make it sound more illegal than it really is
but i mean if you 're defending somebody and um they asked you to bend the truth for them you know for their own good and it 's just you and nobody else knows about it or you know as far as eh
yeah
oh jeez
right
yeah
this is true
yeah
but then again we 're talking about keying a car rather than uh i do n't know like dealing drugs for your brother who 's sickly or something
you know
not no no not that i did that
um but you know as far as it being good for uh the whole party um
it 's like
to protect someone
right
and then you 're putting yourself in in you know jeopardy there
right
yeah
yeah
and then i mean yeah
you feel like the sleazeball then if you do do something like that
and
yeah
right
the best is just to avoid the situation i think in the end
so yeah
i think you did
smart move
right
well yeah and you also have to uh well okay
w- what what countries would be five that you would at least think about before saying no
where where in a africa is it
okay
where in africa
okay
ah do you speak any foreign languages
okay
i 'm just curious because i do n't think i would either
um ah i 'm i 'm p- i 'm pretty positive i would n't either
i 'll
uh i 'm with you
it 's you know we 've got a lot of problems
but they 're my problems
and i 'll deal with them here
right
right
i know
i i 'm i 'm with you
there are some countries that i think are great um that i 've ha- been able to visit and had just an amazing time
and i think th-
eh i have
i i lived there for si- for six and a half months actually
on
i i loved it
and i 've been there a bunch of times
i mean and you say england
but i would include the the entire u. k. which would be i- i- which would include ireland um as well
and you know amazing
but i know you know i- that
i w- both working and play-
i mean i was there on business
um and and between you know times that i was there on business i 've been able to go back for pleasure
and you know very cool
but the bottom line is i do n't know that i want to give up coming back to the u. s. for the rest of my life
uh
exactly
exactly
ah eh eh eh a million dollars does n't go very far these days i 'm tell-
wh- what 's with what 's with you and the you the new york attitude
the what
so ru- why are you so rude
what 's with you
no
i 'm kidding
oka-
no
i live in california
and we
yes
we think you are rude
excuse me
i i i i ca n't do the whole subway thing
i i i 'm a taxi person when i 'm in new york
i
right on
okay
i 'm with you
um i tend to know where i 'm going
i tell the cab driver thi- this is these are the streets that you need to take to get me there because i 've been there enough to know where i 'm going
and i you know do n't talk to me
i do consulting work a lot
mhm
i would n't
um canada
ah canada
england
ah maybe i might think mm d uh
yeah
africa
south america
ah ghana
or liberia
no
i do n't
no
you know what i 'm saying
united states had a lot of problems
but this is a good u. s. a. of america
and the problems that they 're having in other countries
no
i could n't go over there with my u. s. attitude
thinking it 's all about me and not being able to come home
eh that 's true
that ah that is so true
and then about your family
suppose somebody died
you ca n't even come back
you know th- suppose people in your family need you
eh have you ever be- have you ever been to england
well how did you like it
were you able to were you working over there
or were you able to get a job
or what were your what was your reason for being there
i know
that 's pre- that 's a very scary thing
that that is scary
and i was speaking with a friend of mine
and and we 're all we 're all in agreement
no
no leaving the u. s. a. without being able to come back
um ah i- it 's there 's a lot of problems here
but it 's not like i want to leave and never come back
even with a billion dollars
i i do n't i do n't think so
and then a million dollars and being unemployed in a strange culture with a u. s. a. attitude
especially with a new york attitude
i would n't get too far
i really would n't
well well well first of all i- i- wi- wi- i g-i guess they do n't have any respect for people from the united states period
and new york is even worse because we have big attitudes here
we just impolite
you know they call us rude
and eh
huh
about me being rude
you know it 's just that new yorkers we 're not really rude
it 's just that first of all we do n't speak to people we do n't know
okay
this is new york
now when you live in the south you speak to people
it 's it 's good morning you know when you see people on the street
now in new york you ca n't do that because people going to start thinking that something is really wrong with you
do you live in new york
where you live at
you live in calif-
i know it
i know it
the cab drivers
the people on the subway
c- here you are on this crowded subway
and no- nobody wants you to touch them
you know
even taxis can be a hassle
i 've gotten in taxis
and folks not speaking english taking me all over th- all over new york
i 'm passing places twice
so now i got big attitude
now i want to get out of the cab call the cops and the whole nine
that 's a new yorker for you
we 're not going to take this laying down
what kind of work do you do
consulting work
oh
okay
alright
with with with what company
but money is an issue
yeah
yeah
exactly
mhm
yeah
right
mhm
sure
right
mhm
mhm
yeah
yeah
i 'd i 'd hire a bunch of drunks like myself and just get hammered all the time
open some like i do n't know a bar
just get loaded
christ
so i 'd be a rotten business owner in the sense that we 'd be making profit
ach whatever
huh-uh
i do n't need no money
sort of
yeah
yeah
love it
lucky guys
exactly
that 's the way to go i say
yeah
um i have no idea um
yeah
because i 've never i 've never really uh uh um ach how to put it i never really thought about something like this because i 've never been into entrepreneurial enough to to like think up some sort of business plan or anything
but i mean when money 's no object i mean i guess i could be a just the stupid oaf that i am and actually still succeed right
mhm
mhm
sure
yeah
yeah
yeah
right
yeah
and then the rent bill comes in
right
right
right
but m- m- but m- m- mainly doesn- i mean is is that that that 's coming from you have you have a financial interest in this right
you th-
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
no matter what that is
you know well of course
yeah
you know i mean i i have to get i have to guarantee the clubs a certain amount of people to come to the shows or else i do n't get paid
and sometimes i do n't get paid anyway okay
because the music industry is so screwed up right now
there 's s- something ca- in l. a. called pay to play
and you actually have to pre-sell a certain amount of tickets to play at these shows
and you do get a percentage of the ticket sales
not as much as the club gets
but you get a percentage
and then of course y- y- as a as an independent artist i 'm making my profit off of the c. d. sales that i sell or the t. shirts or the stickers or the buttons or whatever
you know and so it is i- in my best interest to get as many people to the shows as possible
but but
yeah
you know i- i 'm i 'm on the skin of my teeth every every show
you know out there hitting the streets
promoting and hustling
and uh that 's something that uh i would well ah eh the first thing i would do money was no object i would hire people to do a lot of this busy work that i 'm doing
so i could focus on writing the music
you know eh so then you 'd have your own place to party
and just uh and then then you have your place of business
and that 's your little hangout
yeah
i that 's that 's kind of
right
and i 've worked for those people before too
the the people who who have gone into business who have uh tons of money
and they just um they 're just like it 's their hobby
they do n't care if they make money or they lose money
and they just kind of like have this place
and and and there 's no structure
they open it when they want it
they close it when they want it
you know and uh
yeah
woo-hoo
if you 're the owner it 's cool
you know and and i- if you do n't mind an erratic schedule you know if you 're an employee
you know i mean ah then it dema- it would matter on like the relationship that you would have with the employees
they 'd have to know that hey this is just like for fun
i 'm going to pay you ten bucks and hour
and we we may not come in tomorrow depending on how drunk we get tonight
right on
yeah
right
yeah
um with money was no object yeah
but i- but then again you know you would n't be necessarily a success in the standards of like business
business is uh you know you would you i think the the definition of it would be that you 'd have to probably turn a profit on your product
you know that type of thing
i mean i eh i never have been eh one to like mm go into this myself
i 'm an artist type
so i 'm very abstract thinking
i do n't like to be as organized as a lot of the business people
but in the music industry you 're going to get screwed unless you learn about it
and i 've really taught myself through the ten years that i 've been doing it how to you know just to protect myself you know uh from crooked mm club owners and and and and you know people who who want to sign you to their label and take all of your publishing
and and you know y- i w- basically if we watched enough uh behind the music specials to realize how artists get screwed over and then it 's like so now you 're like okay
well hit the books you know
y- you have to learn to be s- a businessman in some respects
and it 's it 's taking away from me for me eh the the creative side
you know i do n't have the time to to sit down and and and write as much as i used to
and before i- i was very idealistic
i was just like yeah
man i 'll just write music
and i- it 'll you know it 'll all be good
right
and then you 're like oh
wait
now i have to actually do something
i have to be also the administrator you know of a lot of the stuff in order for it to happen because no one 's going to do it for you
so that 's taught me how to be a business per- and i 'm a much better business person a- as a result
but uh you know it 's not my choice
like i said if i ha- if
well m- mo- my my most most m- my interest is is not eh to see i 'm not even really concerned about making tons of money
i just want to make enough money so that i can get to the next gig
you know i want ma- make enough money so i can do it again next year
you know and there are costs
there 's eh advertising costs
there 's flo- flyers
there 's uh you know gas
there 's travel expenses
we just did a u. k. tour
and we did two weeks in the u. k.
and i had to pay for five guys
you know eating and food and places to stay
and it 's not cheap
oh great
i think they also said that like if someone uh like you could n't tell
like i think like if they give you the money then you could n't like talk to anybody else ever again er like your best friends
so yeah
right
exactly
right
and that 's kind of like my standpoint on it too
i i think i would probably not take the money if it was between my friends or the money just because like you said it is the root of all evil
and some you know down the road it will haunt you
when you see other people with you know tons of money and they 're usually the you know the miserable people in life
and even though they have the money they 're not happy day to day
right
right
exactly
right
and then after taxes you probably get only half of it
so it would n't even be a lot anyways
right
right
right
right
i
i agree with you
no
i agree with you
keep on going
right
i think to a certain extent it is
but then you know once it 's once it 's taken a a little bit too much money of our tax money i think it should stop
right
yeah
i think they 're just telling us what we want to hear
i mean they uh you know they tell you one thing one day
then the next day it 's all you know they 've change their mind
right
i yup
i definitely think ah you know the whole the whole money situation is i would definitely uh you know choose friendships over money because it 's
yeah
i mean every day i mean i live with my girlfriend
and uh it 's there 's so many days where she 's complaining about you know not having money or this or that
and it 's like you know we get by every day
there 's food on the table
and you know we 're happy
yeah
we got a roof over our head
and we both work
and that 's all that 's you know that 's important
i mean if was
no
i mean there 's there 's no amount of money that would make me want to loose all my friends for ah just for the sake of having it
yup
yeah
that 's true
what do you what do you mean by that
just someone looking over you
oh
right
oh is
oh my god i 'm so sorry about that
right
you 're right
you got to be happy
be happy to your friends
and you know what
that person that takes the million over the friendship is the one whose going to suffer in the long run
yup
you are
and you sound like you 're in in ah good hands
oh jeez
right
yeah
i would n't be like that
no
eh regardless
um money is the root of all evil
really
and you ca n't buy friends
you can make friends
but you can not buy friends
right
exactly
and the people who get that kind of money their nose goes up in the air
ah i would n't be like that
no
that would n't be me
no way at all
because i 've had these friends for a long long time and i 'm not going to risk loosing them because of uh a million dol- a millionaire or whatever
eh ah s- yeah
you 're supplying uncle sam but still in all no matter what money you make
and look how many ah l- look how many of our men are dying in iraq
and we 're giving them money
you know but now you know we 're not asking for nothing
but we do want our men back
you know
this is america
ah i think we 're doing too much
and ah
go ahead
and ah you know w- wh- we 're loosing our men one by one
every day you hear
and is it worth it
is it worth it really for our men to go there and help them to rebuild
what are they rebuilding
it does n't sound like they 're doing nothing
yeah
right
right
they eh
because every time when you listen to the news the president bush oh they 're going to need more money to rebuild and all this
and now this paul brennan he 's the one that 's in iraq
i just seen him on the news with president bush today
and it he s- he claims oh they 're getting better and better and better
it does n't sound like they 're getting better to me
they 're getting slaughtered
it 's a lot of bull
that 's the way i put it
b. s.
you know but
i would kee- right
i uh-huh you know all these years i 've been without money
and i could do it again
you got a roof over your head
exactly
it
right
exactly
and well as long as you believe in god above
that 's our main concern too
and i believe everybody has a guardian angel
i had i had a guardian angel already
so i mean three times
twice i went for spinal surgery
in ninety-nine and last year
and then this may i took a heart attack
i never had any problem with my heart
no nothing
it hit me like a brick on the head
yeah
and you you know like i said money is nothing
i- it 's how your health is more important
and you must enjoy life as much as you can because you do n't know how long you 're going to be on this earth
eh yeah
you know i notice that it 's always the good people they die
and the bad are still around
and th- that 's another thing
but ah li- like i said i god could have taken me some you know three times
but i 'm still here
you know
oh
yeah
and i i 'm goi- now i 'm supposed to go for a triple bypass
and i that 's a that 's a li- you know i 'm thinking about that
you know
i 've been in the mills
so you know i 've been in it
yeah
i just i enjoy going to the movies
i just like i like the sound big screen
i do n't necessarily like the people
but i just like the quality of the movie
yeah
the best the best time is like around noon
it 's like nobody 's there
you 're pretty much by yourself
you just get into the movie a lot more
yeah
a little cheaper
how about you
yeah
yeah
texas chainsaw massacre
really
oh
okay
so it was a chick flick
oh
laurence fishburne that black guy
oh
okay
so you so do you like going to the movies
or you like renting them at home
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
that 's true
yeah
um i definitely i do n't like watching movies
well i i do
i jus- i do n't really like watching them at home as much like not even half as much
i just like going out
it does n't really matter to me like w- like whether it 's rainy or or like what kind of weather
i just like i just think like you get a lot more into it
like you ca n't pause the movie
you know so like i do n't ever get up or leave or anything
you just stay tuned to the movie
get into the story a lot better
just a lot better quality
um yeah
i live in a dorm
but i do n't really go with like a lot of people to the movies
i 'll jus- i 'll just go with like a girl or whatever
go by myself sometimes
yeah
yeah
i actually have i mean i have a good set up to watch movies
i mean yeah
like surround sound and everything
and it 's pretty and like decent size t. v.
it 's like twenty-seven inches
but
yeah
it 's pretty nice
so i mean i like watching movies in the dorm
but stuff like i do n't know definitely movies like lord of the rings and stuff like that are a lot a lot better in the theater
yeah
oh yeah
yeah
i 've seen it
i 've seen in the theater and then outside the theater
and that i do n't know at home it 's just not the same
like aft- after you see a movie in the theater and then you see it a home you 're like yeah
okay
whatever
uh anything
that like i love comedies
i like i just watched the texas chainsaw massacre uh the other day
that movie 's good
it 's it 's really scary
like that 's a movie you need to take a girl to
yeah because she 'll be freaking out
or m- mine was
i do n't know
uh it would just depend
i i do n't think star wars type
but more towards like drama or comedy something like that
really
bad boys two
yeah
i 've seen that
yeah
that 's a good movie
i just
i just did n't want i do n't know i did n't really like that that very much
i mean i mean i like the action
but i do n't know i guess i do n't really like action movies as much
especially when people start talking an- and stuff like that in the movies
okay
so you like matinees
it 's a lot cheaper then too
most definitely
well uh my movie going i probably go maybe once a month uh because i do have a home based business
i 'm a little bit more busier
got a coup- lot things going
it 's my prime source of income
and so uh just a little bit busier than normal
and so but i i try to get out at least once a month to see a real good movie
uh actually i 'd just been to one a couple of days ago this last past weekend
and gosh what it what was that
uh i 'm trying to figure out the one i went to
actually i took a i sort of took a date
and she she picked it out
so
uh w- actually it was n't a chick flick
it was one with uh uh what 's his name fish- fishburne
what 's that guy 's name
la- yeah
laurence
yeah
you and uh it was another guy in there that was kind of popular
but uh
well actually i like going out
like you said you know you got the big screen and everything
and the quality sound is a lot better
but then again it depends on what the day is
for example if it 's a rainy day stormy day or you know i 'm i 'm in texas and so our our it can get really cold here so if it 's like a gloomy cold day now that 's that 's a great time to go rent movies
you know more the summertime uh you know or nice weather or something like that
you want to get out
and uh those are the good days where you want to go and uh go to the movies
what about yourself
uh-huh
right
right
now do you have a lot of people where you live like roommates and stuff
okay
oh
okay
right
now do you have a television in the dorm room
okay
how big is it
oh really
aw man
in a dorm room
heck that 's huge
man
ah yeah
yeah
yeah
ah most definitely because you you can hear all the effects
ah
yeah
ther- i did see that
and uh it is great for effects
so i do like that too
oh
okay
no i- i- it really is n't
now what kind of movies do you get into
get out
oh
is that right
so
well if you had a choice what would the movie be
okay
if you had all the all the movies are at the theater and you said okay
i have to go see this
would it would it be comedy
would it be drama
would it be action-packed
would it be you know sort of like the star wars type
oh
okay
yeah
yeah
yeah
i think my number one thing i 'd go see number one is action-packed
i love action-packed
and uh have you seen bad boys uh two
now you 're talking about some good action
now that that was good action
you did n't like the action in it
or
yeah
that 's just i just i just do n't get it quick enough
though i will tell you that the um the game that i absolutely love um i i got it for christmas a couple of years a- well i guess it 's more than a couple of years ago now was myst
ah are you familiar with myst
oh what a wonderful game
i was just i see i like those kinds of games
and and i was just blown away by the um you know just by all the work that had gone into it
it was just amazing
and it was hard
oh
it wa- i just thought it was awesome
i had never seen anything like that before
the graphics the sound the whole thing was just you know i- the music i- it was just
yeah
it was like it was totally like another different world
and um i was on amazon um amazon dot com uh about a week or so ago
and i see that two more have come out since then
and i was thinking oh wow well maybe i 'll just get the package
and then i remembered i i i 'm telling you i must have worked on that game for a month sometime until like hours into the night
i 'd just i became obsessed with it
i i know
well it might be great
but it 's like you ca n't be up at two o'clock in the morning when you have to get up the next morning and go to work
and my frustration level was very high
i i i hate to admit it but i actually did end up buying one of those little cheat books
eh it 's hard
it was really hard
yeah
you had to take notes
but so i guess that really does n't come under the u- under the heading of fun you know when you 're thinking of games and so
but
yeah
but you 're more i 'm guessing you 're more into the action thing
eh yeah
oh you 're that
so you must be really happy with this topic huh
uh yeah
prob- i probably will
you know i i probably will be sucked into it again
you know and then i 'll have to have one of my kids come and help me out because i i do n't know i they 're smarter i think than i am
right
right
yeah
and that now you if you play on that computer now you must also have x. box or you know game cube or one of those things too
right
all that stuff
yeah
and and can you write your own stuff
is that something that you can do
or
mhm
right
oh
wow
wow
an- y- an- ah
yeah
so do you do like action stuff in the apartment
you know like like stuff like that you were never allowed to do in the like in the real apartment
yeah
it really sounds like it
well it sounds like you certainly have a background you know you should be looking for a job in that field
well it
yeah
but if ye- but if are you doing the same thing that your brother is doing too
you know maybe if you checked out doing some of those things or you hooked up with him maybe and you know and you had some exa- some samples to show that may make a difference
do they require any kind of an educational background
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
definitely
of course
yeah
right
right
it
it was hard
ah like i did n't play it that much just because it was n't my style
but i i see where you 're coming from
they just created a whole fantasy world
right
yeah
right
that 's right
yeah
yo-
awesome
that 's great
yeah
yeah
well you have to because those puzzles like you have to see a little button
and you have to remember oh there 's another place on the island that i saw that button
i do n't know
i did n't really
yeah
yeah
just like exploring adventure type puzzle games
yeah
exactly
i just play the action games
and i just i have tons of them
and i actually am like right now i am applying for video game jobs because i just play them so much
yeah
i i i could talk about it all day
so are you are you going to get those sequels to myst
are you going to try those out
yeah
right
or they just know what i think they just have experience with video games
so they know what the video game expects of you
you know
yeah
right
i 'm into the game cube definitely
uh my little brother actually he kind of creates his own things for the like the p. c. games
like like in the three d. games the the games come with pre-packaged worlds that you can walk around in
but my little brother knows three d. stuff
so he he can make your own world to walk around in
it 's really cool because like they 've got a action game called quake
and he created he recreated that is ah the apartment where we used to live
and so it 's great
it 's just like myst
whereas myst is like this fantasy island my little brother in three d. programmed our apartment
it 's really cool
exactly
exactly
we we put guns in the apartment
and so we 're running around killing each other
it 's awesome
it 's great fun
yeah
they just want someone with experience
to get a and and i mean how can you get experience without you know it 's that catch twenty-two
yeah
they moved it
somebody someone probably was complaining about it
exactly
and and and to me then you 're still inhaling second hand smoke
so and and and they they even did that
so i mean and um i- it was
like i tell everybody
i said for me giving up cigarettes were no- was not easy
but it 's just something
it 's no such thing as just cutting back
you have to really quit cold turkey
well at that particular time what i did i just started focusing on other things
and i would go all day chewing the chewing gum you know because you have to have something to compensate for the cigarette
and i was like really a compulsive smoker
so i became a compulsive eater
then i had to deal with the weight
because you have to find something i think to take the place because nicotine is addic- is addictive
it 's very it 's it 's addic- it 's an addiction
and i had to have something to take the place of the cigarette
so i found that i ate a lot of snacks
then i gained the weight
then i had to go to weight watchers ch- eh to try to lose the weight
now i think everything has you know fallen into place now
you know after certain time when you get that nicotine out of your system i do n't think you have a problem
it takes for me it took like about when i just felt like i really did n't miss them and i did n't really need a cigarette it took me at least about two or three years
it 's a long time
it it that 's what i said
i said it 's your own personal struggle
now whether it takes someone sooner or not i do n't know
but it took me at least three years before i i just felt you know nicotine free
that i could even you know sit up and have like a cocktail or drink or something did n't have to have a cigarette
but eventually everything goes
so i do n't even you know i do n't drink any alcohol anymore
anyway so
you know that 's gone
so and i mean i do n't drink at night
because most of the times when you have a drink it 's with a lot of times you go after work
this place and that place
or it 's a holiday
and everybody has a glass or something
and then it 's a cigarette
you know but i do n't do either one
but
yeah
i i do think that it 's a good thing to to to have a smoke free environment
but a lot of people they are they feel like it infringes on their equal rights
other people
yes
yes
well they have it in delaware
not in pennsylvania
but in delaware
i 'm we 're we 're in i 'm in close proximity of delaware
and that is another state that banned it in their bars
and they 're
yeah
they did
but a lot of people were really like when i watched the news like the evening news or the late news and a lot of the people there the citizens you know the people there they were really against it
i think this one particular bar they continued to smoke
but they were fined
so that just showed how strong you know they meant what they said that you know we 're going to enforce this
yeah
okay
okay
and then she was saying something about they were setting up different programs or something like that uh that would help people to um kick the habit i guess
yeah
ah
ah
no
i do n't know any right off
i probably you know i probably will have to do my homework when it comes to that
you know but i 'm sure there is quite a lot of programs out there
but see they 're geared to the smokers
like i always say when you have these special programs or special things that smokers see on television the advertisements like the patches and those type of things that 's geared toward those people
it 's like going to the sermon in church every sunday
the ones that should be ah there are not there to hear it
you know
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
so i mean a lot of times you know people that smoke like i say they enjoy it
and they have the tendency not to um want to stop
and that same picture that you saw with the two lungs
well that 's a good idea too
because people had to walk through the entry way to get to work right
oh yeah
sure
right
how how did you do that at that time
mhm
mhm
right
right
it definitely is an addiction
yeah
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
how long does it take to to do that
you know to
mhm
wow
that is a good long decompression period
mhm
right
right
right
yeah
i can i can i can understand that argument
but it just the problem with it is that it endangers other people
right
and that 's the problem
when somebody 's right infringes on another person 's right
so that 's that 's hard
it 's a hard debate
but it i think it 's a good thing
boston recently banned that kind of thing in all of the bars you know and and nightclubs and restaurants here i think
so that 's been a positive thing too
hm
mhm
uh-huh
well that 's good
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
good
that 's good
i remember when i was down in new york recently
there are few i think they have the same kind of policy
but there are a few bars that ah had applied for you know a specific smoking license before that ban took effect
and they kind of had a grandfather clause
so that 's where smoking could occur
but besides that i think that seems to be working pretty well
yeah
yeah
now i do n't know about them
but ah ah i mean have you have you heard any more about those programs
mhm
right
uh-huh
you 're yeah you 're you 're preaching to the wrong people it seems
like you know
huh
uh-huh
that 's a good point
i mean like you said it 's they they know a lo- you know by now everybody knows the risk
but they just decided that it 's worth it to them
you know
no
i 'm not
okay
mhm
i agree
um i think it 's kind of ridiculous to ban it in like bars and clubs and stuff like that
but in restaurants i think definitely it 's a good idea
mhm
m- my father smoked from the time he was thirteen to the time he was like fifty
and uh he 's very very ill now because of it
yeah
so in general i am in favor of pretty much anything to uh to encourage people not to smoke
uh well i think they 're a good idea
i do n't really think they are that effective
but
yeah
exactly
i-
i know it
yeah
i know i know my father it took like three or four time- times to quit
and uh with my sister she 's still smoking
and she 's tried to quit like five or six times
yeah
mhm
well yeah
hm
um
well i 'm in uh
i 'm in santa cruz california
so california has some of the more stringent laws about uh smoking in public places
yeah
how about you
where are you at
oh
okay
yeah
probably
mhm
well uh w- there 's uh no smoking in restaurants
i believe there 's no smoking in bars or clubs here
uh i know in a lot of uh in a lot of places like uh outside of well i 'm a college student
and outside of the college dorms
yeah
you 're not allowed to smoke within like fifteen feet of the building
so
uh yes
yeah
um
pretty much
yeah
i 'm sorry
what
uh
i do n't know
they they might
but probably not because you know
yeah
well
okay
well they probably have uh like privately run uh programs
but i do n't think they have any actual like uh public you know school funded programs
yeah
i i think it 'd be good if they did because there 's a lot of people that smoke on campus
but
mhm
yeah
mhm
yeah
okay
w- well that 's good
i mean you know like you said it depends on yeah
if you want to quit you can
i think
like i know i realize how difficult it is
but uh
yeah
exactly
mhm
exactly
and
yeah
i think it 's just a like it he- it helps people that are going to quit that would probably be quitting anyway
it just like makes it a little bit easier to do so
hm
mhm
and that 's you know definitely a positive thing
i- i 'm glad they exist
but uh
yeah
just themselves just
oh
i agree
i i definitely a problem you know
right
yeah
um smoking
are you a smoker
i am a smoker
um the ban in restaurants
i think it 's a great idea
yes
because i i i do think most restaurants are too small for non-smokers not to be infringed upon
so did either of your parents smoke
really
really
yikes
yes
right
and so what do you think about all the programs
i do n't either
i i just think if you y- you either want to quit or you do n't
and i i suppose if you 've never smoked well i suppose you probably do n't
i mean i f- guess you probably know how hard it is to quit
i have quit for three years
really so you 're lucky really that you never got into that
do they have smoking bans in your area
i m- where
i 'm from indiana
really
there is n't there is some around here
not much
in some of th- um indiana
yeah
so it 's quite earlier a lot earlier where you 're at
uh i think indianapolis has some bans
but i do n't think it 's really widespread yet at this point
oh really
uh-huh
really
do they have smoking areas
and they all like congregate there
hm
do they offer non-smoking cessation stuff at college
do they offer quit smoking classes and programs for your school
hm
hm
i know they have some of that stuff around here
but it 's like i i 'm kind of from a small town
so you know i 've heard of people doing the hypnosis
right
hm
yes
yes
esp- because i sometimes i think if they could catch you early i mean at a younger age than let it progress even further
i 'm thirty-four
so not that i 've been smoking forever
but it seems like it
and w- i did quit like i said for three years
and i did not use a program such as that
i just
quit
right
right
you just
but you just have to do it
and i and i 'm sure the programs i i m-
i do n't know because i 've never participated in any of them
i 've heard of the hypnosis
but i 've heard that does n't work
but i suppose if you want to quit you can make any of the programs you know work for you
right
right
yes
i agree
i absolutely agree
right
but back to the restaurant and the public eating facilities
i just think you know when small children
i just i just do n't agree with smoking in the public like that
i i just think it 's terrible
i mean i even think it does n't even set a good example for small children to see adult people sitting around smoking and laughing to associate it as something that 's good
yeah
there you go
because i i 've been to the south
and i know that a lot of people smoke in the south
and both my brothers moved there
and then they both started smoking
and they became chain smokers
yuck
yeah
and i i think everyone does it there
that 's what they told me
but maybe everyone that does it g- you know that goes to bars does it
you know i do n't know
yeah
i totally agree
yeah
no
does n't make a difference
yeah
did they ban it in seattle in restaurants
oh
it it is here
yeah
they banned it here a c- probably a couple of years ago
and i know a lot of people are unhappy
because so i 've heard stories where er you know read in the paper where someone will be smoking in a bar
and they 'll you know come in a ticket the bar for letting them do it
you know but you still see people doing it you know now and then i think
but i mean th- as a non-smoker i think it 's good
but then if i was a smoker i 'd be like hey
you know like they 're always like outside you know crowded outside like trying to smoke and stuff
and that 's gross too if you want to go outside like if there 's a patio
because we have a baby
and he 's really messy
so a lot of times we have to eat on the patio
and that 's where they let smokers smoke
and so it 's like ew
you know let 's sit like away from everyone
and
so i guess hm you know advantages and disadvantages to every you know kind of thing like that
and
yeah
yeah
yeah
and it kind of seems like it goes along with drinking
you know i do n't know if you 've been to europe
but i mean every- you know everywhere you go people are smoking and drinking
and it 's just
yeah
yeah
they must think that we 're really silly here over here
yeah
that 's true
it 's like much more social maybe
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
that 's true
you really
yeah
no comparison
plus they 're a lot more laid back in
oh southern california
yeah
no
like kind of right in between
so w- we 're at the beach
and then so it seems like the the more mountainy communities like to the north south and east of us all got it
so but we had a lot of ash
and that was really weird
that that has to do with smoking
no
so
yeah
so no
we 're
yeah
i know
my sister 's house was pretty close to to uh one of them
and so that was kind of scary for a couple of days
and i think she was probably smoking a lot
see there you go
yea-
they all smoke all my siblings
yeah
is n't that weird
and i 'm like the only just
ew
get that thing away from me kind of person
you know especially now that i have a ba- i just never you know had the just the the desire
i probably tried it when i was a teenager
and my friends said you look so stupid
and i was probably like yeah
because i had such a baby face
and i it must have looked ridiculous
yeah
i just did n't
yeah
and it 's so expensive too
i mean i 'm shocked
i 'm sh- i had no idea you know because i do n't smoke
and i was in the market
and i went oh my god
a case is you know i do n't know thirty forty you know whatever
i was like wow
so what do you do
i th- i do n't even know
maybe more
maybe a-
yeah
twenty
but
yeah
i- i think so
because they 're pretty small
but
yeah
i know
i was like oh my god
so h- if you 're if you do n't have any money how do you you know afford it
it 's it 's it 's it 's an expensive habit
i do n't know
yeah
so anyway i do n't know
yucky
that 's an easy topic
yeah
yeah
then we could sit and argue and stuff
that 'd be cool
yeah
so i forgot what the original thing was like the restaurant thing
and i did n't i did n't write it down
oh okay
yeah
yeah
oh really
yeah
oh yeah
and you 're like okay
what am i doing
yeah
i hear you
he 's fifteen months
yeah
there 's not too many people that smoke in seattle
so there 's smoking topic
yeah
oh
really
yeah
i-
yeah
it 's prevalent in the bars
and i know in dallas there was a lot of controversy i think over restaurants banning smoking
i mean i i thought it was great
um just as far i mean i you know you do n't want to be eating and have somebody smoking right next to you
um and even if they have separated smoking areas it never um seems to work
but a lot of the restaurants in dallas and i do n't think it 's unusual of most places they have bars included in you know as part of the restaurant
so that was i think what was part of the biggest problem
i do n't know
i have no idea
i think
okay
yeah
y- yeah
yeah
because then
yeah
uh yeah
yeah
well i understand what you 're saying as far as the smoker feeling um alienated i guess because his rights are being impinged upon as far as you know his right to smoke i suppose
but
oh yeah
i- in europe
yeah
it 's impossible not to have someone smoking around you or near you something
yeah
probably
but i think in general things in europe i do- i do n't think people are chain smokers necessarily
and i think
i think they 're m- much m-
yes
i think they 're much more moderate in their drinking habits as well and and all sorts of things
so
yeah
where in california
sorry wh-
oh
okay
eh ha- were n- near the fires at all
or
okay
yeah
yeah
sort of
someone left a cigarette in the woods
oh okay
would she want to
eh not related
oh okay
okay
good
i 'm proud of you
oh
yeah
it
no
i tri- i tried once too
and no it was just no fun
and like this is stupid
yes
right
really
for uh like how many are i think there 's what ten cigarettes in a pack
i do n't even know how much that is
and
yeah
maybe twelve
i do n't know
oh
really
twenty
okay
shows what i know
eh yeah
i do n't know either
crazy
yeah
totally
yeah
i know for us at least
it 'd be bad if we were i do n't know maybe it would be good if we were both both in opposition to each other
then we could have really really great ten minutes for these people
no
i did n't write it down either because i was like whoa
new thing
um because they 've called t- they 've called me a couple of other times
and i was really tired
and i just did n't i did n't want to participate
so and then once i actually called
but there was no body else at the time to talk to
because i waited for like ten minutes on the phone
and no one ever picked up
so i was like whatever
hm
yeah
how old is your baby
i think for me the big p- question would be like what 's the magnitude of the terrorist situation
you know what i mean like if it is it something like you yourself are threatened directly
or is it just like as a group
and
yeah
because
i mean
exactly
i mean in like in the example with the airplane you know if one person decides they 're going to you know start acting crazy that could lead to you know serious lives being taken
whereas they did n't really know they were going to die prior to
and it 's not like anyone was actually telling them that hey we 're going to go crash this into a you know a building
i mean they probably more or less knew just you know we 're being hijacked
we have no idea where we 're going what 's going on
just do n't freak out
or it 's going to cost people lives
yeah
yeah
it 's true
mhm
especially if like families are involved
like people on the plane with like you know th- you 're there with like say your kids it 's going to make it a lot different because you 're not going to want to make your kids scared
as far as like the trade center i think the big thing with that would be like you know i guess positioning
i mean like you know you 're trained for things as far as like you know proper exit routes and stuff
but i ca n't imagine what it must have felt like to be you know thirty forty stories up and you know i 've got to climb down seventy flights of stairs now to try and get out
yeah
just doing the plow line
knocking people out of the way
yeah
exactly
so it 's like you know i mean that 's one of the survival of the fittest things
you 're just thinking you know the only thing between me and the door is these people
these people are going to get out of my way or i am going to make them get out of my way
yeah
um i got a d. v. d. for free about a from uh the world trade center
and there was a a portion of the documentary where there was a guy that um carried a dude that was in a wheel chair
and he carried him down with him to help escape
i thought that was really i mean i ca n't even imagine being in a situation like that
i mean he honestly did not know him
he was just like in an office building saw the guy in the wheel chair trapped in a stairwell and picked him up and carried him out
i ca n't imagine myself ever doing that
i mean in a scenario like that i 'd be much thinking way too much about myself to think about you know this person or that person especially if i did n't know him
that would be my kind of attitude to just be like you know i want to survive this thing you know no matter how bad it gets
i 'd like to live through it
and then you know i would n't exactly leave room for helping you know people especially strangers
or like the group of firemen that went in at like that last couple of moments before it came down
i ca n't imagine that
i mean you know the whole place is like it 's on fire smoldering and whatnot
and they 're running into it
i mean i 'd be much more running away from it
i mean fire fighter or not that that was bold
i do n't know
i guess eh i
right
and that can make a big difference because you would n't want to react um you know eh freak out
like this is going to effect everybody because you could get people killed
right
right
right
yeah
i just i was amazed how the calm was you know and you know what you oof how calm people were
um i ca n't say eh i ca n't say that w- i maybe w- would be that calm
i 'd be maybe maybe they were frozen in fear too
i
yeah
i 'd probably maybe i would be hm frozen in fear
it 's really hard to say until you 're there
but you 're y- you 're right in the magnitude of the um of who it 's going to affect
if it 's just going to affect yourself well certainly i would react differently probably than if there was a lot of people
um mhm
right
yeah
definitely
definitely
um mhm
and i probably would have reacted like you know fight fight
i i 'm just eh fighting down the you know because i mean y- you know you 're going to die probably in that situation if you do n't get out
um i do n't know
eh i can see myself probably just pushing people out of the way
you know i mean i would n't i would n't think i would want to do that
but you know when i think in that situation well i 'm going to die if i do n't leave
right
right
because you know at that point i ca n't imagine that i would be thinking oh well let 's stop and help mrs smith you know down the stairs
i 'm like heather heather heather
oh
you did
okay
holy cow
so he was n't even thinking
huh
well
right
tha- eh
yeah
that 's that 's amazing
i ca n't i do n't know
eh i would think i would want to do that
i certainly would think i would want to you know help somebody else
but like i said if you 're if you know you 're going to die and the place is coming down uh
yeah
it 's all for me
man
r- right
yeah
yeah
right
yes
it was
you know i i think ah y-
yeah
that they do not necessarily that
but they do hm you know they help save people and and stuff
but
alright
well terrorism is bad
we 'll start there
um where you live
okay
yeah
i 'm in the city
were you here when september eleventh happened
no
i actually just moved here about six months ago
yeah
what was that like for you
wow
hm
well i guess they asked um whether we think most people would panic in a terrorist situation
which is kind of a weird question because you know obviously there are a whole bunch of different kinds of terrorism
so you know i think obviously if there was you know actually anthrax in all our mail or something like that then everyone would panic
but
yeah
but when you have stuff going on it 's kind of an interesting thing
i was in um virginia when september eleventh happened
and it 's sort of like i- you know you have something really horrific happen
but most people in the rest of the country do n't feel like they 're in a target area exactly
you know
yeah
so you know people kind of have this sort of really you know like a non-specific feeling of
yeah
so everybody 's like really tense
but it 's not as acute
you know like you 're not going to go to a therapist and talk about it
you know and nobody 's like offering counseling to everybody or something like that
you know it 's just sort of like you do n't really know what to be scared of
right
although you know i was actually when the blackout happened you know people were re- you know there was there was no rioting
you know people were remarkably calm and things like that
yeah
and at least in the beginning i mean we did n't really any way of knowing you know whether there was a some kind of non-innocent reason for the blackout to happen
so i mean that went remarkably well
hm
yeah
i do n't know what do you think about um airport surveillance
it 's gotten really crazy to try to fly
yeah
i do n't know i mean i feel like you know if airport security actually worked i would n't mind being you know held up by it and that kind of thing
but i 've read enough articles
i feel like what they 're doing is is really ineffective
and there 's kind of harassing dark skinned people
yeah
so it 's kind of scary
i mean especially you have um there was a story in the news recently
some college student brought i do n't know really cherry bombs or something on an airplane just to prove a point
and of course i mean that 's a stupid thing to do because now he 's probably going to be in federal prison for a really long time
but um nevertheless i mean every time somebody has done a test like that you know people just you can bring anything on an airplane
ah
yeah
i mean i remember like i remember reading stories about people who you know like uh people who had a gun on them because they were a security guard or a hunter or something
and they just forgot to declare it
you know so it was just an accident
and they brought it on a plane
and half-way through they realized you know they have a gun in their suitcase
and
right
exactly
you know and it just happens you know too frequently
so i feel like we 're all being you know held up in the airport and feeling really tense about it
but they 're probably you know they 're not really helping things
yeah
i think they 're adding a lot more um air marshals though
which which is good
you know you 're going to have those sort of plain clothes people on the plane
yeah
and you know it 's kind of funny because you know we we 've always had them
i think that they started doing that in the seventies um with the air marshals
but there is just so few of them
so chances were you know there would never be actually be on your plane
but of course you did n't know that
you know and so
yeah
we 've been doing it for a long time
but it 's just you know w- there were n't very many of them
so maybe like one in twenty planes had one
but the idea was that everybody would think that they might there might be one
so you 'd be less likely to do something
mhm
ah staten island new york
oh okay
eh yeah
yeah
how about you
oh wow
wow
yeah
it was a real scary place here
um it was it 's nerve wracking
i still i 'm still scared
i 'm still afraid every day
i go to work into the city
and every day i feel like something 's going to happen
so you know a plane flies over head and i look
and i wonder if it 's going to crash into something or what 's going to happen
yeah
it 's nerve wracking
mhm
right
definitely
oh wow
mhm
except for her-
yeah
like a safety net
yeah
it like it 's far it 's far away
it 's a foreign type of feeling
right
oh god i think it 's horrible
i n- i know from seeing people here i i definitely think here people would panic if there was any kind of attack anywhere only because we 've been the center in the target of so many things so far
so
yeah
which was really surprising to me
mhm
right
right
see i know me myself i panicked
that 's just me
but i 'm i 'm extremely nervous about everything since september eleventh
i 've i have n't really got past it
so
you know but as a whole people reacted very well
yeah
yeah
i have n't flown i have n't flown since
um but my mother flies a lot
and i know she goes through a lot
but i i guess i feel safer that they 're doing that instead of slacking off and just letting things fly
right
harassing people
yeah
oh yeah
mhm
yeah
definitely
hm
if you really want to
right
yeah
and they 're sitting on a plane
mm
that 's a good point
that 's a really good point because there have been a lot of flaws in the security systems of all the airports
and that college student with the i do n't know if it was box cutters or bombs or or what he brought on but it was that was eye opening
definitely eye opening
mhm
right
which they should have
i think definitely
especially planes that go long distances or planes that go international
they need to have people
oh
wow
yeah
that i did n't know
oh
well gosh
eh i did n't even know about it
yeah
ah yeah
i agree
um i guess whenever like when they had the o. j. trial on i remember it
like i was pretty to get home sometimes
just to watch it
um just to know what was going on
but uh you know i mean i think you know it it 's court
it 's supposed to be you know one of the three branches of the government
you know just let it do
i do n't think it 's necessarily something we need to see
right
right
i i can understand that ye-
yeah
because it is it is educational too
um it is
right
yeah
mm eh but it it seems so sensationalized though at this point you know really with like court t. v. and stuff like that
and i do n't know
yeah
so i mean as long as it 's it 's there for what it 's there for
like say we have a w- we get a like on c. span you have uh ah i guess like house meetings and senate meetings
and that 's not real you know sensationalized
it 's there for you know education
if you want to see it it 's there
you know i think that 's maybe o- an approach you know court t. v. should even take
eh mhm
right
right
right
yeah
okay
yeah
i ah that 's a that 's a very good point
i c- i can see that
yeah
and maybe it wo n't be such a a big event sort of say like the o. j. trial was because that was kind of like the first major televised trial
and i guess people were really interested in that
but if it was readily available maybe perhaps not
yeah
right
right
and that 's that that could be just why that trial was so big in in that sense
and why we were so interested because we can sort of relate with who it was
but it was more readily available as far as like everyone else even i think the the excitement about it wo n't be as big
but those who are interested can you know can watch i guess
mhm
right
uh-huh
right
mhm
right
right
and a good example of that now is like the kobe bryant trial getting ready to come up
uh just that i do n't i do n't know if i do n't think they 're televising or or doing anything like that with it
i have n't really heard
but i can see where playing the media to you know get support either way
um
because it 's with that
or it it will be anyway
right
hm
yeah
uh that 's that 's true too
well i mean you think what what did we do before we had televised trials
anyway i mean
right
right
right
yeah
right
yep
and we still have them now just for the same reason
yeah
we s- we have those now still for the same reason
yeah
right
right
but i remember when the o- the o. j. trial that was the only thing anybody talked about
yeah
i agree
i 'm i i think it 's important that it be available
um i think people that want to see it should be able to
i 'd i 'd like to see a lot more trials um televised
mhm
well that keeps them honest
you know
i agree
right
yeah
i agree
the ah being able to watch those trials uh i think it 's less important
how can i put this best
i think it 's less important that i personally see o. j. 's trial or or ah what 's the guy blake his trial than it is the trials in general be public because it keeps the it it keeps the la- law system the legal system in general honest
and i think that 's critically important
yeah
yeah
the ah the idea of a celebrity trial i must admit is is a a little off-putting to me just because it 's such a media circus
you know
um mhm
yeah
the ah
yeah
the you know when we watch these ah these celebrity trials i have to admit i think the trial the celebrity trials more than the oh you know joe dokes gets pulled over for speeding for the fifth time trials um i think they 're actually a a good um a good advertisement for not televising
and i think the ah the defense uh especially very often want wants to play out the trial in the media
you know they 're they 're not so much working the court as they are working the papers
and i i do n't think that 's a good thing
mhm
mhm
yeah
and and i think you 're right
and i think the ah the whole playing the media is is a bad idea
uh but like i said on the other hand i think having secret trials is a really amazingly bad idea
oh newspapers
yeah
and uh i do n't know if you remember
the newspapers were forbidden to bring photography equipment into the trial for just years and years
and so we had court artists
um i beg your pardon
i 'm sorry
yeah
and i i think that 's a mistake
i and i think i think we should be able you know we the people should be able to see our government in action
um i thi-
me neither
yeah
yeah
um well i mean do you think it 's i do n't know i mean i s- a lot of times uh it seems our legal system well it either appears to be just a big circus to us or i mean it is you know because of there are so many different ways that um you know entities can appeal decisions and uh you know um say that some things are un- unfound- are you know unfounded evidence or whatever
mhm
right
because it 's all just abou- it 's all just about like what peop- who someone obviously is lying
you know eh in every court case i mean someone is usually is telling the truth and someone 's lying
you know and so it 's always just eh it 's there 's a there 's a lot of um dishonesty um in the air
and you can just you know you can just feel the tension
that you know it 's like well you know obviously someone 's lying
and there 's no real way that we 're going to know who it is um you know because if it was that cut and dry there you know there would n't be you know a case really
you know it would n't be televised
mhm
hm
yeah
oh yeah
yeah
i do n't know
i mean and like i think a lot of people do these do s- crimes um you know in um the heat of the moment
and um then other people of course do n't ever think they 'll get caught
but um
yeah
definitely
uh being tele- televised and uh you know have your whole life i there in front of the world
and you know and that 's like your life
but everybody else just to them it 's just s- another soap opera you know
hm
yeah
mhm
yeah
i mean um however you know like uh with all those you know like michael jackson uh i- um cases and everything and settlements
um you know but he 's still like huge
not just in you know europe or the rest of the world but i mean he he 's recently done like works
wi- he 'll like he 'll have new albums come out and just like the um you know will top the charts and everything
and he 'll do projects with all these other prominent musicians
um mainstream musicians
things like that
well i mean but then again he kind of just settled with everybody though
you know anyone that um that filed charges against him he just settled with everybody
and there really were n't any trials
kind of but i mean i-
mhm
but then and then um but then again like let 's say like o. j. simpson trials
um i mean uh
yeah
because that was um me too
i mean out of out of trials being televised because everybody uh eh i remember i i was just i was in high school when that when that happened
and i remember everybody just uh was like you know running around like all surrounding the t. v.s and everything
and and then there was a this like huge th- um you know issues with with um racism and you know like saying that you know people that were you know african american were all like um so uh glad that he was got off on innocent
and not all
but i mean there was kind of like that kind of a theme going around
that was kind of like an issue that people a trend that people seemed to notice that people that were of african american um ethic origin um were you know happy that he got off
you know and you 'd notice like a lot of people that were you know caucasian perhaps um were just like they were all disgusted with our legal system
you know
i 'm not sure
uh i have n't seen too much televised trials
i got bored with them pretty quick
thought they were a circus and kind of made a mockery our legal system
yeah
it seems like the th- person with the most money and the best lawyer or who has the best lawyer
that it 's not about justice
mhm
yeah
well i wonder if being televised i know a lot of people do get into it and like to watch it
and it 's sort of like a soap opera
i wonder if it helps anybody stay steer away from it like other celebrities that do n't want to be televised in a court case think twice about doing something
like i often wonder if they televised um capital punishment if less people would commit the crime
yeah
especially being a celebrity out there
celebrity
and i 've always heard that uh publicity whether bad or good is still publicity and keeps you in the public 's eye
but but i think we do judge uh celebrities on bad events
and keeps us from wanting to see them later in shows
and i think it might hurt them from making money later which would
mm
so it did n't hurt him at all
so it was just m- more rumors of what was being said and done
it was n't the same as watching a trial and it all being drug out and
hm
that 's the one that comes to my mind the most
hm
yeah
yeah
you never know
so
mm bu-
yeah
mhm
mhm
oh
god
that 's funny
yeah
yeah
yeah
i do n't know
maybe if you have like a history of drug use or you know that kind of thing then you know maybe it 's a good thing
but i do n't know
i mean you definitely do n't want eh you know your doctor or somebody you know where you know your life is in their hands to be doing that
so so i think it does it 's kind of dependent on your job as well
so
mm
yeah
or like you were saying even like truck drivers an- and all of that
you know anybody 's operating heavy machinery
you know
should be tested
yeah
yeah
i know
well i do n't know if it 's like incorporated as a regular part of the job you know i mean if you 're if you 're driving trucks all the time then you know every week maybe you would have one or something like that
but if it 's just kind of oh we 're going to have a drug test you know then you 're like i don- d- it feels more of an invasion that way
you know
but
yeah
yeah
or a pilot
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
exactly
yeah
i do n't know
it does ka- kind of give you you know from another standpoint some security
you know if everyone 's been tested then then i do n't know you kind of have a little bit of a feeling of security that people are n't doing drugs in your work place type thing
and so but you never know
so
yeah
yeah
yeah
they do a lot of drug testing here actually as well
so
the
um eh the only one i 've had is is the one for the company that i work for now
um but i do- i do n't know
i i i hear a lot about it
so
eh yeah
maybe so
i i think it 's just a standard part of of of getting hired here
so i do n't know
yeah
yeah
yeah
so i do n't know
mm but
yeah
i do n't know
is it a big practice um in california
yeah
yeah
yeah
did you um they air it here in california
um that they were they were looking they were advertising like dumb criminals on this dumbest criminals show
and the guy was trying to get around from showing his parole officer that he had not been doing drugs
and when he went in to test um ag- apparently the f- the parole officer gotten a a phone call saying that they believe this parolee was doing drugs on the job
so the parole officer called the guy in
and he said oh no
i 'm not on drugs
or and he say okay
we need a test
and then the gentleman said the guy said well i i ca n't use it
but give me a few minutes
he went out to the car and waited and then came back
and when he gave the test they tested the drugs
they tested his system for drugs
and then they said well we got good news and bad news
the good news is your test came out negative for drugs
but the bad news is you 're pregnant
so so he 'd use- so you know he used his wife 's or whatever 's urine to pass a drug test
and you just never know
you know people you know they those tests could be accurate
i do n't know
mhm
that 's true
that is true
yes
yeah
that 's true too
yeah
i guess it would be dependent on your job
hm
right
absolutely
that 's right
anyone who 's operating heavy machinery definitely should be taking one of those tests
you know
you just never know
but what do you you know uh wh- what do you do when a company do invade your privacy and you 're not one
and then they can have you taking tests every time you turn around
mhm
yeah
that 's true
mhm
yeah
yeah
that 's that 's truly would feeling like an invasion opposed to being a tuck- truck driver or operating heavy machinery or or dealing with children you know or someone at work dealing with children
and you do n't know who 's with your kids
and they they i think they should possibly be tested for drugs so when tested because you see so many people on watching your kids and they have the cameras hidden and beating your kids
so you wonder wow somebody could do that to a kid
are they on something
mhm
mhm
mhm
yeah
it 's um i eh i do n't know
i think texas you guys are pretty eh drugs are pretty bad there too
that 's like california
th- and they they always i i hear texas eh i mean y- eh i do n't know you can just come out and oh i do n't know what part of texas you live
but i heard dallas and houston they say when you come there you you will be able to find a job
you get hired some companies same day
so d- do they do a lot of drug testing there though
is it because of the kind of work you 're doing right now
mhm
okay
but is it an office job
and they do it
and that 's just the the procedure they go through huh
hm
wow
i i guess it 's just well they the companies know
the have their reasons for having certain positions
and certain companies do it
so
yeah
yeah
they do a lot of drug testing here
yeah
just about just about any job i 've w- went to applied for probably eighty percent they they th- they uh required me ah to take a drug test
and i 'm in sales
but i do dri- i do a lot of driving
but
oh
okay
o- no
i understand
i do the same thing
yeah
really
oh
my goodness
right
wow
well no
i would n't blame you if they were
yeah
pulling guns
right
right
right
like
that was what you told me to do
huh
it was like a dream
huh
well no
you 're right
that happened to me
or well not exactly
that did n't h- exactly happen to me
but i was five months pregnant
and i took a flight up north
and so i had a layover somewhere
and both times they stopped to check me
and i w- o- you know the entire time i 'm thinking okay
i know you 're checking every fourth person so on and so on
you know but r- really how effective is that
after a while e-
it 's kind of it 's kind of
i do n't know i- it was just eh it seems like we 're wasting so much money so much effort on the airports
and i know the airports are important because that 's just what happened to us you know as a country
that was really horrible
and so we 're all extra paranoid about airports
but i i j- i- personally like i just do n't think that 's going to be the next attack
i think they say okay
we did that
that worked really well
but we 're going to you know like you said come up with something new
well especially when you are dealing with people who you know are n't scared to die for their cause like that
you know and they have no fear of that at all
you just ca n't think that some of the stuff they 're trying to do is going to i do n't know i just do n't feel like it 's necessarily going to work
but
yes
i- yeah
like i. n. s.
yeah
oh
jeez
right
right
e- right
i know
well that 's the thing is that i think we 're supposed to be you know the land of everything
and everyone 's supposed to want to come here
so we 're supposed to let everyone here
you know but then
but then we we then like you said you know you there 's certain people they do n't allow
you know an- like we keep out all the people from or we try to keep out people from cuba
for some reason that 's the worst country out of everywhere
you know it 's like
yeah
so um i think
like you said
but there was like a side of the road
so i just pulled over
and oh i 'll just sit here for fifteen minutes
and then i 'll go in
and i 'm so cheap
so we 're like sitting there waiting
i have my kids in the car
and we 're listening to music and talking
and all of a sudden i mean like within one minute w- of you know us thinking we 're going to sit here for fifteen minutes we had security on us with guns
we were so freaked out
and they were screaming get out of there
get out of there
like what in the world
you are it was like you are scaring my children
what is wrong with you
i- i had no idea what they were doing
and i would n't open the door or the window or anything
because wha- i mean i did n't know if they were terrorists
you know and so that was the only thing was the approach was like really extremely high tech
but i did n't know if they were really the police
so i thought well we 're not getting out
and i took my driver 's license and held it up to the window just to identify myself
and i 'm like we 're not doing anything
we 're just sitting here
we were going to wait for and im- they 're screaming the whole time
they could n't even hear what i was saying
and um the uh one guy was screaming move it
move it
move it then
move it
and e- so i put it in gear
and he was standing right in front of my van
you know and i 'm like well you move so i can drive
i 'm i 'll move
if you get ou- i do n't want to run you over
i know
and i- i could n't even you know i got in the parking space
and they 're like gone
they were totally disappeared
and i looked at my kids
and i w- said did that just happen
i know
and so it 's you know is this all effective
i do n't know
i was freaked out by it
i was like
i was kind of afraid to get out at that point and go pick my sister up
mhm
mm
i do n't know
right
mhm
yeah
right
because gangs do n't do the same thing twice
right
um well i think what they really need to focus their money on is where they fell through the y- um
w- where everything fell through the cracks is is was on border security
you know we had all these people
i mean my girlfriend 's husband works for um what do they call it when you come in the country and you have to get approved and that department
uh yeah
a- g- so anyway h- he she has n't seen him she did n't see him for eight months after this happened
because e- and our prisons are so full of all these people they went out and arrested that were in the country illegally
you know like what are we going to do with you
you know and then you got this mexican guy trying to get a drivers licenses in this e- election now for um illegal aliens
wait a minute
if you 're illegal get out
what do you mean
you know i mean there were
the president was trying to back them and get them in
i forgot what his name was
but they were all you know sad because he walked away from it
but i do n't know it 's crazy
it 's like w- what happened to just thinking normally and saying other countries do n't let anybody come in
i do n't think so
w- right
well we started you know this country f-
mhm
mhm
all right well they can be like too
and you do n't have one
mm
mm
mm
right
right
mhm
i have had a good family
i 'm my family most of my family is gone
and my father died what about two years ago
and my mother died about a- month ago
i have my sister who 's in california
and i guess we can consider her a friend to some degree
uh
yeah
for for about forty years she did n't talk to me
it took my father 's death to wake her up i guess
so now she talks to me like w- like it 's old home week
you know
i live in new york city
sh- yeah
she 's in the the biggest dust bowl in the west bakersfield
she has five of them
mm
god loves her
i 've never had any kids
never got married
i live in new york city
and i came back here back in nineteen sixty-two just to see how the other half lived and got stuck because my car quit
here i am
so then you 're like you know
and darn near forty years
but my family 's still family
me and my mother when an- before she died was okay
my father was okay
it took them years to basically uh you know how parents are
they they uh kind of mate- have a maternali- um m- maternal instinct
l- oh like the mo- mother bird who took care of her birdlets or whatever
mhm
well see when you g- when they get older and they become grandparents and then the then the the game changes
you know i mean as you well know
as you bes- should be aware of that
they want to spoil your kids you know naturally
they want to give you e give them all the things you never got
mm
i do n't want you to spoil my child
say they say shut up
we 're the grandparents now
mhm
oh yeah
uh-huh
yeah
the sho- the shoe 's now on the other foot now
right
now if if you became or y- when your kid has a kid then you become a grandparent
you probably want to spoil them
sometimes you think they 're not when you 're raising them
i know
u-
mm
right
well that- that 's where the family thing comes in
you know because how what does family mean to you
that in tha-
oh
oh yeah
of course
and they they can kick they can kick in their two bits worth and hopefully help out when you 're when you 're moving
whether they 're aw whether they 're aware of it or not
from that point of view
no
i 've actually i 've ne- i 've never met my sister 's kids except one
i still have four more to meet
so ver- very soon hopefully i c- i can
you know
we we have something coming without getting too uh in- into it
w- w- you know there 's an old saying
where there 's a will there 's relatives l- like vultures on the back fence
but i have something coming that way
and i may ha- in fact take a trip out there somehow whether they want to see me or not just show up
you know oh hi
how are you
it 's uncle mike
you know
oh
i i kind of we- i kind of welcome them
but i was not i 'm not like the vulture on the back fence
you know
okay
they
yeah
yeah
okay
what did they leave you
you know yeah like with the greedy ones is-
yeah
so so families
um they mean a lot to me
uh right now um i mean to me personally right now um as we go through good times and bad times the family 's just always there for you
i mean friends are always there for you too
but
yeah
oh yeah
oh definitely
yeah
friends can be your family too
definitely
yeah
i did n't want to forget that
um to me a- so- some of my family members are my best friends
so this is a really easy subject for me
so
h- how about you
do you have a good family experience
or
mm
mhm
yeah
where so y- do y- so is is she distant from you then um l- location wise
okay
mm
mm
where d- where do you live right now
okay
and i live in california
so mos- so so most so your sister 's in california
and and everyo-
okay
okay
how about kids or nieces or nephews
or
she has five kids
yeah
okay
and is
mm
yeah
so your family 's so so you 're
of course
yeah
definitely
definitely
i have a i have a two year old child
and i 'm i 'm married
and i have a child
and my parents are still i- you know very m- maternal and paternal
yeah
definitely
definitely
yeah
definitely
yeah
they 're definitely not as strict with me as they were
they 're definitely they 're definitely more lenient
that 's exactly what my step dad does
my step dad spoils them on purpose
and he says remember when you were growing up i told you i was going to get you back with your gr- when you had kids
so
yeah
yeah
yeah
there you go
you know i think that um children are uh you know are a blessing definitely
but it 's a lot of work e- when it 's your own child
yeah
there it 's definitely a challenge when they 're yours
but when when you 're a grandparent or th- say nephews and nieces you get all of the all of the benefits
but none of th- like you know
exactly
yeah
like for instance my husband and i we were recently you know ha- were recently going through financial hardship and um like you know were moving
and um my f- my f- a lot of my family is within driving distance
so it 's just been such a blessing to have them near because like say my sister was able to babysit my son for a a day or two
exactly
yeah
so it 's e- um
i mean i ha-
yeah
definitely
yeah
so do you see your your sister 's kids a lot
or are you are they all in california
oh
okay
oh wow
okay
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
oh gosh
oh no
mm
that 's really uh tough when it comes to death and if there 's like an estate left behind because my my grandfather recently died
and some of u- some of us like me um i do-
yeah
but it 's tough when others are
and they just have like we have we just have we kind of an issue going
you know at the moment probably not a really really close friend
i have a couple of friends who are pretty close
but um i do n't know quite what it is trey
i think we 're just maybe a little bit different in the way we approach things
um and there 's a little bit of a w- hold back
you might say they 're like eighty percent of the way but not quite ninety or a hundred percent
that 's a little hard to describe
but i think maybe our interests are different
our approaches to life are different
and we treat people a little differently
so one of them 's a family man
and i 'm single
and so he kind of has other preoccupations
and the other one is a guy who 's let his finances go pretty much to the dogs
and uh ye- i do n't know he just does n't seem to have he never has any spending money
and you know its- jus- it 's i- not enough
yeah
i- because w- well you know you just
yeah
yeah
if it involves money it 's going to be awkward
and you know i can treat him
but um
and i do n't mind treating him
but it just feels like w- f- come on
you 're forty-one years old
pull your own weight
yeah
not too much to ask
i wonder
i i do n't think necessarily
i know one of my sisters really both of my sisters are married with kids
and i would n't guess either one of them has more than one or two very close friends and maybe not even that
maybe just more acquaintances that they know from church and stuff
yeah
uh-huh
mhm
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
well that 's really good
i do n't know if i have anybody quite that close
i used to
and then very strangely uh he borrowed some rent money one time
we used to borrow e- from each other every once in a while if we 'd need a little float like a hundred dollars here and there
and uh that was n't an issue or anything
but then one t- one time he said he needed to borrow like seven hundred fifty dollars to pay his rent
and uh you know i gave it to him without hesitating
and then and then i i did n't really pursue the repayment for s- probably six or nine months because i wanted to give him some breathing space
i did n't want him to feel like i was breathing down his neck
but then when i finally approached him about it he was really funny about it
and he he did n't want to repay it
and finally he just said he was n't going to repay it
and that pretty much ended our friendship
no
he really did n't
oh
good
oh
that 's a lot
yeah
yeah
hey
excellent
that 's so great
mm
yeah
mhm
yeah
right
right
yeah
yeah
it 's hard to be frie- it 's hard to be friends with poor people
what can you what can you do together
right
yeah
except get together and talk or you know whatever
yeah
yeah
mm
yeah
get your act
yeah
oh yeah
yeah
i wou- i do n't know if
i- e- i 'm c- curious too whether um women have more close f- friends or best friends than men do
you know
i mean
mhm
mhm
yeah
i would say i have well i have my sister
but um i have a very close girlfriend that i could t- i could tell anything to
and she she 's i 've known her for probably oh gosh probably since since ninety-four that she 's been you know th- that we 've been close
so that 's you know pretty pretty long time
but i could call her and ask her for anything
and she and the same way i would stop- i would drop uh anything for her because she 's she 's got a very good heart
i would feel bad if i w- if i would n't reciprocate
but uh
yeah
she 's anything i would ask she would do
so she 's a g-
yeah
it 's a great a great friendship
you know
yeah
uh-huh
mhm
oh
yeah
w- di- he did n't have a reason for it
oh
hm
yeah
we recently well it recently recently got the money
but we had done s- something similar to that oh maybe two years ago
and somebody said they were going to you know pay us pay us back
and we did n't really know how to handle the situation
but you know within the last three months then all of a sudden he came up with the money
so it was a good thing you know because it was like god how do you ask
you know and it was like uh eighteen hundred dollars
so it was a lo- you know it was n't something to just you know just well seven hundred is n't something to you know but you get over it
but when i thought oh god
you know what 's you know and i mean we would talk to them and you know s- see them
but they would never bring up bring up the money thing
you know like oh i know i owe you
and i 'll you know they never said a word
and then all of the a sudden he calls one day and says you know what 's your zip code
you know and uh he sent us you know uh two separate checks
you know and it was like e- you know and we thought when we got the first one we like oh well we 'll wait another two years to see the rest of it
but it happened w- you know like within a month
you know and it was like wow all right
yeah
yeah
because i 'm thinking oh you know they- f- you should n't even have to
i do n't know
yeah
but um
yeah
he 's lucky i guess in that respect
but i do n't get to see much of him because he has n't been back here since um he was in ohio about ten years ago
yeah
well he comes back two or three times a year if he can if he you know uh gets a chance
but
uh what are prices in real estate down there like
um
oh i 'm getting off the subject
yeah
uh illness
let 's see no
i do n't i do n't do any flu shots or anything
um i do n't know if people down there do
mhm
hm
well we 're not big on vaccinations at all
we 're not big on vaccinations
yeah
well yeah
my family
yeah
uh i do n't know
um i do n't think we trust them
i mean you never know
well i know
that- ye-
yeah
and you may be the one in a million that gets it
or one in a thousand or whatever
you never kn- really know
i mean they you know they act like it 's a a um cure all for all these diseases
but sometimes it causes disease too
right
so you 're b- b- we- you 're may- in your thirties about
oh
are you
oh jeez
so y- you 're in college
huh
yeah
we just got back from a trip to disneyland in southern california
and i was sick the whole time i was there
this is on the subject
i was sick the whole time on our vacation um from a bad cold
it felt like i had walking pneumonia
yeah
it was miserable
and now i think my wife 's got it
oh yeah
about what a month ago month an- about a month and a half ago
two months ago now
um
mhm
oh
yeah
well
yeah
you 're definitely exposed to it a lot more that way
and uh
yeah
we have kids in school too
and they probably bring it home
well i 've got i 've got um they 're eight ten and twelve now
yeah
so we um
we 're real busy
and i have t- two grown kids
yeah
um
and um
i did n't um
i not sure
was there a number of topics listed on tho-
no
i think they just they just bring one up at a time
um i
oh
is that right
huh
um
oh
yeah
yeah
i do n't know what 's going on
maybe it 's the um maybe it 's that mosquito v- virus that 's heading west or something
i do n't know
yeah
west nile virus
i-
uh i do n't i do n't think anything like that has showed up
and then they had that that scare with the sars virus
uh
how are we keeping our health
yeah
how are we keeping ourselves healthy
uh exercise
lots of liquids
um eating healthy food i guess a lot of fresh vegetables and fruits
we 're vegetar-
well that 's a lucky guy
yeah
oh
really
right
yeah
um
you know uh
yeah
i 've seen s-
yeah
a lot of people are doing do the flu shots
my mom always had us doing flu shots forever when we were kids
but uh i have n't
what 's that
y- you as in your family
or
oh
okay
why 's that
yeah
you know there 's a lot of sickness that just comes off those vaccinations
yeah
yeah
sure
mhm
absolutely
no
actually i 'm uh i 'm in my early twenties
mhm
yup
just uh going to school and whatnot
yup
yeah
really
what a great trip
now this was r- obviously recent then
right
mhm
jeez
so hm i do n't know it 's not really our season yet to be getting all this sickness
it usually takes us i mean san diegans in general till novemberish you know right around there
so this is really kind of hitting earlier than normal i think
but uh
i do n't know and usually i do n't catch a lot of things either
but i probably just being cooped up in the classroom all day kind of will do it to you
sure
how old are your uh children that are in school still
oh
really
yeah
i can imagine
i 'm trying remember what the uh
i do n't know what what other topics
di- you you hear all the topics before we get on the line
do n't you
i- we- well it was like
you know they s- they said like illness to me
and then said several different things on my line
yeah
they wer- they were all illness sort of related though
so i
were all under the same umbrella
w- are you talking about uh um west nile
yeah
yeah
wy- they 're starting to see a b- little bit of of that around here
how about around around uh oregon
oh yeah
yeah
that was
yeah
you know i do n't really know what constitutes reality t. v. because the new show i am really into is queer eye for the straight guy
i do n't know if you watch that
yeah
yeah
i
right
well fortunately i have watched a lot of them just out of because i think it 's interesting
it 's sort of similar to like a bad accident
it 's just this morbid fascination with
uh-huh
right
because that 's actually educational
yeah
yeah
right
yeah
right
exactly
yeah
yeah
yeah
it- it 's pretty horrendously trashy
and i think i think that 's sort of the appeal
is that people i think it sort of serves two purposes for two different populations
for people who can relate to the trashiness i think that they feel a little bit less alone because you know they see people who are r- just as ridiculous as they are
and then i think for people who um m- you know are not that way then it 's almost reassuring to realize that there 's the frame of reference that you 're completely
you know and it almost reassures you that oh my gosh i hav- i 'm really an intelligent person because these people are lunatics
so yeah i think it 's just interesting
yeah
right
right
but it 's it 's definitely interesting that a lot of the reality shows like survivor and bachelor are all about sort of back stabbing each other
that it 's really you know lacking any sort of values
and i wonder if
you know i mean it really is just a really very individualistic
and i need to survive
and i 'm going to get the money
it 's all about me
and how i it worries me that really sort of perpetuates some pretty lousy values that i think are already e- on t. v.
but it 's interesting
i think it 's interesting that there is such e- big audience for that sort of you know for t. v. shows that are basically teaching you to do the absolute wrong thing
and so i do n't know it 's it 's pretty interesting because they are very very you know awful
they 're just like how much how much can i um you know trick this person lie to their face and then get them to believe that i 'm a good person
and it 's just really really awful
so
yeah
it 's interesting that people enjoy it
but uh
yeah
yeah
yeah
it 's like the morbid fascination of seeing an accident
on the side of the roa- and you just feel like
right
no
i do n't
but um actually tha- that 's not as ridiculous as some of the other ones
i 'm thinking of more like joe millionaire and um you know that kind of stuff
um i ca n't remember all the names
y- you know now that i am put on the spot of course um i would n't know
but ten minutes after i 'm off the phone i 'm sure i 'll have a whole list of them
uh-huh
i guess i w- i watch a lot of um like c. n. n. n. and history channel and all that which is kind of reality
but it 's not you know
i mean i know that 's not what they 're talking about
yeah
it 's ig- ag- exactly
and i find i watch so much of that that um when i want to watch something for p- purely entertainment purposes i guess i go more for either sitcoms or you know even dramas you know where the reality stuff it just looks like um
i do n't know just l- i guess it just to m- to me look like people that um you know are are desperate for their fifteen minutes of fame
so now instead of having to parade their dirty laun- linen on like oprah or um you know one of those um talk shows you know now some people have other ways to get their fifteen minutes of fame
but i mean you know some of the stuff like you know like um you know tha- you 'd see um i mean i 'm not into talk shows either
but you know like when you 're flipping channels and or you 're stuck waiting for a commercial next um men who wear their women 's clothing w- um while whate- you know whatever you know something ridiculous next on oprah
you know so i think just seeing those daytime stuff has turned me off that by the time the night comes i definitely do n't want to see anymore of that kind of stuff
uh-huh
yeah
right
exactly
yeah
no
i- i think i agree
i think that 's part of what the appeal is
i think also um
i guess everyone has their own little dramas going on in their lives
and you know if they ca n't
if they can escape i- you know i see it as an escape for them
even if they can relate to some of what 's going on the fact is it 's
whoever 's on the show is it 's their reality not the person viewing it
so for them it 's just escapist fare
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
oh
yeah
i think there 's so- some kind of um
some um i ca n't even c- articulate the right thought
uh
some kind of s- uh o- perverse um satisfaction i guess in seeing you know someone screw someone else over
ex-
yeah
it 's on a mi- more you know uh uh less um intense level like when they had the shows like who want- um who wants to be a millionaire you know the regula- the regular games shows
um w- where i think there was one the one from britain uh the weakest lin-
um yes
well i 'm lucky
m- m- most of my family does live in new york
i have some relatives that live outside of new york
and a couple of times over the years they did come in for the christmas holidays
but usually it 's just my immediate family that lives in new york that i see
and and may- i do n't know w- where your family is if they 're all in connecticut or if they live in other places
but if they you know if they live in connecticut the- you probably get to see all of them you know at christmas time
oh
you have a big family
how nice
and do they all live in connecticut
oh
only two
and the two that do n't do they come in to connecticut during the christmas holidays
right
oh
good for them
and that you 've been to ireland
they say it 's really beautiful you know the country you know what i 'm saying you know the w- you know everything about it you know what i 'm saying the land
you know what i 'm saying they say that it 's such a pretty you know and beautiful place to go
oh
good for you
good for you
so i know we have to talk more about christmas for the rest of the time
neither do i
i know they just said you know talk about christmas you know or your favorite holiday i think they said
both of us do like and you know christmas i- that 's our favorite holiday
and probably most people you know would say christmas
hm
i do n't know
um easter
um mhm jul-
yeah
that 's true
every holiday
right
is different especially to different people
you know they celebrate it different ways
right
but christmas is a holiday where people usually give presents or a g- g- or receive presents
so it 's usually more fun you know what i 'm saying j- because you g-
right
right
because you 're getting gifts
even if you 're old because i 'm not young you know it 's still nice when you get a gift or you give a gift
you know what i 'm saying it 's a nice feeling
right
and um you know
oh yes
mhm
that is
especially here in new york
if you 've been to new york you know
um the stores and going shopping you know what i 'm saying it 's like so outrageous
you know what i 'm saying everybody 's r- running around looking for a christmas gift especially at the last moment
you know what i 'm saying if they wait it 's so the stores get s- really so jam packed
and i know you have big stores up in connecticut but not like we have here in new york macy 's and you know bloomingdales
so we really have so many people coming into new york during the christmas season
you know what i 'm saying so you know new york c-
that 's right
everybody comes to new york
you know
right
right
s- right
so that 's why
even if people do n't live here but if they come to visit someone during the christmas season there are always so many places for them to go and people to see
and you know what i 'm saying i- you know what i 'm saying so that the city is so busy during that season
you know what i 'm saying and i like it because i 'm a new yorker
so to me it 's all right
but you 're from connecticut which is probably a quieter state than new york
yeah
i know you 're not far
right
which is not far
okay
but still i 'm sure it 's not as busy as new york city
you know
right
oh
does it really
oh
i did n't know that
u-
i see
i understand
oh
they are n't
right
right
right
and of course new york also you know a lot of people do a lot of walking in manhattan
you know what i 'm saying so you know that even if you do n't go in or come into manhattan with a car even to walk around is so un-
it 's unbelievable
mm
right
and so oh we did talk about christmas
and we talked about what we like about the holiday
i do n't know what else we have to talk about for ten minutes
what holiday would i create
i would just say a c- a festive holiday you know a festive holiday where you know you get to see your relatives and your friends
and you know i would say something where you also give gifts or get gifts because it 's always nice to get something you know what i 'm saying that you 've always wanted
you know what i 'm saying and you know christmas time usually you get things that you you need or you 're really wanted
so i would make a holiday where people get to s- come together and be spend time with each other and exchange gifts also
right
but i would n't call it christmas because there 's only one christmas
i would just i would just say it just to celebrate um
does your family all come down here for christmas
right
we actually live there 's six i have six brothers and sisters
yeah
yeah
only two of them do n't
yeah
they come in
um they usually come down for christmas unless my sister 's overseas
um her husband lives in ire- well lived in ireland
and so they travel back and forth
he 's got a house there
yeah
yeah
i 've been to ireland
it 's great
mhm
it
it is
it 's nice
i 'll be going back next year again
yeah
i know
i 'm like hm
well i do n't know what they want us to focus on
right
like what other holiday would people choose
i 'm like what 's so great about easter
well i guess every holiday is different and special for everyone
mhm
right
yeah
heck yeah
when you get gifts
right
it 's also mo- one of the most hectic times though
yeah
right
yeah
mhm
well you get you get all you get everybody coming in
and it 's just kind of like you 're like well this is my place to this my home town
this is where i shop
you know
mhm
we 're actually we 're only forty minutes from m- grand central station
so
yeah
no
but actually the traffic here it gets really bad yeah
because stamford 's one of the fastest growing um cities on the east coast
so
yeah
because we have this this bank move in
so everybody 's actually coming commuting here
there 's as many commuters coming in from new york as there is going out from here
so it 's even during the shopping time it 's hard because everybody 's just constantly coming and going
and our streets are n't built for it
like new york at least has the has the travel routes that you can take even though they 're jam packed
yeah
yeah
you 're like come on
mhm
we had we 're supposed to talk about what holiday we would create
what holiday would you create
right
mhm
you 're like oh that 's a guess
right
uh well
yeah
you know as as uh people get married they move
they m- have other people that they need to be with because they bring in another you know another side of the family
so it 's not you know it it starts just to split off a lot
but then we at at christmas time i i get to spend time with all the people that i like and uh the family that i like
and at other times they um say like for the fourth of july they might go with the in- with the other side of th- the husband 's family or the wife 's family
and how do we celebrate it
with lots of food
yeah
lots and lots of food and lots of talking lots of music
mm mm
no
we listen to other people play
i
i think if i had to n- name something for our family i would say i- we 're more of a uh spiritual family
and it 's
the holiday is more centered around us as a family than as a um you know than than religion because it 's just more about about us
yeah
yeah
that 's what i sa- w- um we more celebrate our s- family than than than the than uh a religious holiday
yeah
yeah
and if i had to create a a a holiday i- i- it would be around children
it would have something to do with children
and and i we 'd celebrate it by celebrating children just letting them lettin- n- letting them have a f- a fun day because most of the holidays a- are
not there 's no real children 's holidays
i even think that christmas with the buying is more about the adults than it is about the children
but everybody every country stop shooting
yeah
that would be some holiday
yeah
uh d-
is your family spread out all over
or
right
right
yeah
mhm
lots of food
that 's cool
i- i mean do- does any of your fa- family members
do they play music like play instruments
or
yeah
just
um are you fri- religious
i mean do you i- is there that aspect of christmas
does that appeal to you j- as well
mhm
mhm
that 's cool
see i
i 'm like complete opposite
um uh i just i e- really have come to hate christmas
it 's like my least favorite holiday um j- largely because i 'm not religious
and for the most part i guess i 'm kind of cynical because i do n't really think very many other people are
like i do n't think that they 're celebrating like christmas um as being you know you know theoretically as being the birth of christ and stuff because
yeah
yeah
yeah
and that that sounds a- a lot cooler to me than than the other stuff
and plu- plus i just feel like it 's gotten so commercial
you know and there 's so much expectation
you know i mean that y- you like see y- these parents that you know go into like this almost crazed mobs you know at the m- shopping malls trying to pick out or pick up you know the latest fashionable toys or whatever you know that you know their kids absolutely have to have
you know
because i 'm of like these
way back in the day it was just like the cabbage patch kids
and you know then
i do n't know
whatever th-
you know i mean there were like
some lady got trampled remember her a couple years ago because they had that tickle me elmo doll
it was like the big thing and stuff
and i 'm like hang on people
you know let 's get back to what it 's supposed to be about
but
yeah
i like that idea of a family or a gift
yeah
hm
hm
that 's interesting because i- i remember like i remember saying something similar to that like years ago probably like almost twenty years ago
and my my stepmother was like every holiday is about children you know except for mother 's and and mother 's day and father 's day
but she 's like she was like
insists
sh- you know she insisted that you know every holiday you know kids got a whole bunch of candy and or fireworks or you know or presents or whatever and stuff
and um i do n't know
i think ev- or sh-
i wish they co- that we could have more of um i do n't know more e- like an international peace day and stuff you know like an i- you know an international cease fire week or month or whatever
you know
yeah
yeah
that would be hm
that 'd be some holiday
s- i would vote for the president that enacted that
i i uh there 's there 's some towns out in california the minimum wage is uh ten or twelve dollars an hour i think
and that 's just because of the cost of living in those areas
but in minnesota if you 're if you 're working for minimum wage and you know what that
if you 're working for minimum wage and the pay you get ca n't you know it does- it does n't meet it does n't help ends meet then you probably need to look for some skilled labor or some assistance from the government
yeah
you go to mcdonald 's
and cheeseburger would cost four dollars
and it 'd also take half an hour to get it
i mean no o- no one 's really it all depends how you look at it an- and who and who 's giving an opinion
if your- if you 're an employer you 'd want the minimum wage s- you you would n't you 'd want the minimum wage to stay where it is because you do n't want to have to pay people any more than you already are paying them
but if you if you 're someone who 's working for minimum wage or someone you 're dependent on is working for minimum wage then you would want the minimum wage to go up
but then in your case when you 're working as a nur- a nursing assistant or helping someone with health care you 're making nine dollars an hour
and you have somebody working at mcdonald 's making eight dollars an hour
do you want to work hard as a- in nursing who makes nine dollars an hour
or do you want to go not do anything at mcdonald 's and make eight dollars an hour
yup
so they 're just they 're basically living on the money they made over the summer
and we have a lot of hispanics that come up here and work on sod farms and other farms
and in the winter they go back down to mexico
they work for a minimum wage
but they also ge- they get free rent up here
and they they go to the western unions and those money grams
and they send all their money right back home
no
i used to be
yup
they do n't i do n't know
maybe they make two thirty-five
um i know
i have friends that are drivers for taxi cabs
and they make a minimum wage
but they get a commission also off the fare
but if their commission comes out to be more than the minimum wage they have to pay their minimum wage back
i do n't know how the program works exactly
but it 's it 's legal
and it comes out they make about seven eight bucks and hour
mhm
wow
that 's what i 'm thinking
yeah
mm
it could put someone out of business
y- you mean in uh in other words um also ploy- employers would n't be able to hire as many workers
or or-
oh
i get what you 're saying
but do n't you think we need an increase because it would um motivate people to work better if they
i mean if you 're working for five something an hour my god by the time the hour 's up you 're like well i made my five bucks
and you 're like oh god
but i know i made nine dollars here w- doing um nursing something not really nursing more like home health care
i was m- so glad to get that because it 's hard work
um i just think they should m- if for no other reason push it up because of cost of living or just to boost in- uh people 's egos
i do n't know
maybe i 'm wrong
um
yeah
yes
yeah
up in north jersey i live in south jersey
w- we have it split
they pretty much want to be two separate states
but um north jersey at burger king i- i think it was they 're making nine
not that that 's minimum wage
but uh i know what you 're saying
that was to start
i had to work up to nine dollars down here because it 's a tourist area
and things close down in the winter
so i 'm sure our employers are glad to have the minimum wage like you said at five something because e- u- if for no other reason th- the tourists do n't come down
and um businesses are slow at this time of year
yeah
w- are you are you
yeah
we have a lot of kids from ireland and russia that come over
and to them it 's like gold
they 'll work very hard for the amount of money that um the local people here wo n't work for
an-
mhm
really
and they 're getting minimum about
oh
that 's good
now that i guess that makes sense because it must be a poor country
yeah
are you a- a student
uh-huh
um i did n't get as far as actually college
i 've v- done all tech schools after high school
but um i uh we had programs where that th- uh the cost of living was offset by maybe like you said free school or something free even though some people get minimum wage
i think our waitresses down here get two thirty-five plus tips
you too
around there
mhm
that 's good
oh
now that 's different
i have n't heard that one yet
oh
okay
i know where my daughter works in a restaurant down in cape may
um they get the two thirty-five
but they it 's a bar restaurant
so they also get tips from the people that drink
but then they have to split some of their tips with the bartender
so the bartender always makes out well
and the girls usually do pretty well
but um it 's hard
and as far as what you said about whether i would do what i 'm doing for nine dollars and hour or work at a burger king or wendy 's
i would n't i- n- no let my kid
well i 'm a single parent
so i have to watch what she 's listening to
and between music and things that are happening on t. v. say well
uh-huh
right
was it marketed for children
or was it marketed for adults
that 's the thing
for kids
right
exactly
and n- and not just that but a lot of the other cartoons and and children programs that 's out here too
you have to like you know screen them
yo-
mhm
sounds like my kid
i have a seven year old
exactly
uh
i thin-
exactly
i agree with you on that
uh that 's because they 're probably seein- not not parents or not seeing the the the point
we- you know so that th- the kid 's eyes um you know well how is it affecting them
you know and like uh because like you know i get u- you know this the the same thing with these movies one thousand and one dalmatians and stuff like that
and there 's things on that
there 's words that she should n't be saying
you know and she goes out and she uses them with her friends
and then i get you know w- a kickback from their friends ' parents
you know well your daughter 's teaching m- my daughter this word
yeah
well guess where she learned it from
you know no it 's like uh
yeah
really
uh it 's like you know times have changed
but then again when cartoons were nowadays i do n't know how old you are
but you know i 'm back in the
it was violence
and you know violence was supposed to have been funny
and nowadays it 's like you know it seems like all these video games and things kids watch it takes effect on them
and they want to do some crazy stuff or re- reacted in a awful way where somebody 's getting hurt
yeah
yeah
true we have to have somebody who 's going to study this stuff
and uh
yep
but then again you know
yeah
really
i have to block those out sometimes
i really
uh of course you know they 're interest- kids are interested in learning
a- and they want to you know
when you tell them no you know what happens
say and they do they want to do it even more
yup
yup
and uh
what during the daytime
oh
okay
well then again well if you look at i do n't know if you have uh f. x. x. out there
but uh they have nip and tuck
and and and they get pretty uh you know into some th- you know scenes that you know uh where it should be on h. b. o.
like last night i was watching
i 'm saying oh whoa
okay
i 'm glad my daughter 's asleep
you know
oh goodness
oh it was a pregnant woman
that that n- needed her uh to have uh she was in her ninth month
and she needed her husband to have sex with her in order for her to you know m- i guess bring down the child or something
and here they were showing all these positions all these positions you know until she a- orgasm
and then you know she says oh yeah
that 's the spot right there
and she went through the orgasm
i 'm saying whoa
okay
all right
uh f. x. x. is getting kind of porno here
well you know when i uh saw shrek i um i was shocked at how often they um used the term ass for donkey
and um because i 'm like all right
this has clearly been marketed for children
i mean you know they 've got the ice cream
they 've the toys
they 've got
well but that 's ju- i think that i think the humor was for adults
but i think the movie was marketed to kids
a-
yeah
i um i have a friend who had a seven year old
and she l leaned into him
and she said you know ass is another word for donkey right
and he said i think we all know what they mean mom
uh-huh
so you know it 's like and and actually my i was um a little more offended by it than my friend that has the kids
she 's like i really did n't think it was that big of a deal
and i was just like i do n't have any kids
but i was just like i 'm kind of offended that that they 're pushing the envelope in this way
and and um you know i think they 've kind of mis-marketed this movie because they 've asked these kids to come in and now they 're you know kind of throwing this out at them
but i seem to have stood alone though
when most people that i talked to they were like oh no
it was n't that big of a deal
uh-huh
right
right
right
right
you know learned it from disney
right
right
yeah
you know i guess it 's it 's interesting because you know you 've got adults designing the comedy
and so uh but then there 's you know in tha- those particular cases if they 're designing it for kids i guess it 's a tough field because you 're you know you 're designing it for kids
but you got to you got uh parents that you 've got to have that are willing to come in and watch it
so
yeah
that even balance
so i guess it 's a difference in in whether you air a you know a sitcom at eight o'clock in the evening or whether you air it at nine or uh whether it has to go to h. b. o.
yeah
i bet
i just saw
right
yeah
they
very true
i uh just saw on uh i forget where it was going to be going
but um i saw online that uh sex and the city was going to uh they 're they 're going to re-air it on s- in more of a commercial broadcast area
so they 're going to have to kind of clean it up
i think it was sex and the city that
no
uh just that they were going a- it was going to air off of h. b. o.
so you know there 's
uh-huh
oh wow
right
yeah
i have n't seen that
i 've heard a lot about the show
but i 've heard it was kind of dark
i did n't um
could be
i have n't i have n't uh you know looked at that lately
but it u- that 's true
that used to be that way
so you 're thinking you 'd get i guess a million and a half in the end
right
well i was thinking okay
so like if you left like what if you could find some investment to throw your million in that paid like maybe five percent which would probably be hard to find today
but you know in the old days you could get a savings account that paid that much
remember that
well i mean i do n't know how old you are
but
so i was thinking you know if you could find something that
and now you 're saying a million and a half in canada
that 'd be what
fifty seventy thousand a year
yeah
well d- so you never thought of like the caribbean or anything
huh
oh
really
oh
you 're a lawyer
that is so funny
my husband just passed the well he pass- just passed the bar
we found out last friday
yeah
so you got any words of wisdom for him
really
well his he he 's in a unique position that he had a career
and then he went back to law school v- you know through his company
and now they 're saying to him that um you know we spent all this money putting you through law school
but we 're really struggling
so right now we 're going to have to just hold you in the position you 're at for a while
and he 's thinking gosh you know i did all that work
and
you know
yeah
well they they did n't have him sign a contract
so um anyway but um
anyway i do n't know
are we supposed to go back to the subject
or can we go off on the subject
is this your first call
how did you hear about it
yeah
ha-
have you initiated any of the calls
or have this or have you waited for them to come in
yeah
oh so you called in yourself tonight
how long did you wait because i called in too
and i waited
well i heard blue blue my world is blue three times
did you get that same
oh
you did
well i figure it 's easier if we call in we can you know d- do it on our own time
well do you do you go online a lot
uh well there 's a um i found out a- about it on a website called volition dot com
and um it 's a great little website that tells about these odd studies and you know odd things going on odd ways to make money um that kind of thing
it 's a great little website
and um someone on there had said that um you know w- one time they had sports
and it was two women
and they did n't know what to say
and they just kept you know talking and talking
but they said the same thing it 's like it 's an easy way to make thirty dollars
volition
it 's v. o. l. i. t. i. o. n.
volition dot com
yeah
check it out
k- you go on
and there 's a l- a forum you can go into
and it has different things
i do um i actually do mystery shopping
and um that 's where i found out find out some of my the companies that i work for
y- they post jobs on there
and it 's a neat little it 's a neat little uh you know website
i 'm not a big computer buff myself
but um you know it helps for the business
so
so this is your first one
are you going to initiate your next two also
you signed up this morning
oh my gosh
well i signed up last week
and they had n't called me yet
i do n't either
i do know that did n't um did you eh when they sent you the email it said something
di- does n't this study stop in like december or something
did you read that somewhere
oh
you did n't email them
oh
okay
mhm
oh
uh
oh really
no
okay
so you- in the midwest you said
now is that where you were born and raised
u- wisconsin
i can hear it in your voice
so you never had the urge to
yeah
i 've
d- i- you have a million and a half canadian dollars
canada is pretty close to america w- you know the same language same t. v. shows same society pretty much
mhm
yeah
yeah
be enough to- i think it 'd be enough to live on
nah
i- i think i 'd like the climate better in canada
but then i 'm a lawyer
so be i- it might be hard for me to move someplace else because i 'd i would n't have a job
yeah
great
yeah
no
um
eh i 've learned a lot on the job that they never taught us in law school
so
yeah
yeah
so he can go find himself a different job unless the company wants him
ma- it 's going to make him stay because they paid for it
yes
a friend of mine emailed me and said um call it up som-
it 's a fast thirty bucks
so figure what the heck
ah actually i had something on my answering machine when they were trying to get a hold of me
so then i y- called in myself
yes
no
i got right away
yeah
yeah
ah well i do n't know
w- it 's a lot probably
three four hours a day at work
mhm
what 's it called
volition
yeah
i 'll check it out later
yes
probably unless uh th- the computer calls me at a right time
i- i did n't expect them to call me until fifth
i first signed up this morning
yeah
yeah
so i was kind of surprised
unl- or or maybe they the the study started
and that 's why
i do n't know
i did n't get the u- i uh
n- you know what no
i did n't i signed up over the telephone
th- i gave them my e-mail address
the woman
this is a linguistics study
the woman who was taking my information she was not very linguistic in english
but i- i 've run into a lot of that lately
yeah
yup
wisconsin
yeah
no
i could n't accept it
i do n't think i could at all no
because you know friendship worth more than money
you know
i think so
yeah
sure does n't
u- that i- that is
huh
i was i was thinking the same thing
like man
y- yeah
because if you build a relationship with somebody like that you know and as a friend you could n't i do n't know about that
no
you ca n't
really
yeah
well that 's s- that 's something you ca n't you ca n't buy off
you ca n't buy off friendship
you know
m- yeah
yup
you 'd be blessed you 'd be blessed to have a few good friends
you know
yeah
no
that was real
that was real
i 'm uh
i 'm from um los angeles
yeah
panama city
oh
okay
yeah
i 'm from los angeles
b- born and raised
y- ah
oh
okay
u-
yeah
i feel the same way about that
i 've got friends that i 've been having since i was a kid
you know
yeah
yeah
yeah
well i only moved probably when i was little i- we probably only moved a total of three four times maybe
so but we always m- excuse me we always moving around the same neighborhoods
yeah
mhm
yeah
right
right
yeah
i had
yeah
yeah
yeah
because i remember when um once when we wer- when i was little and i had just started junior high school
and um we had to move because our h- our house had burnt up
and um i thought that was messed up too when i had to change schools and everything
i do n't really have any people that i really consider my best friends
but i mean if if they were to put to where i could n't speak to like my children again no
i would not accept
no way
yeah
there 's a lo- there- there 's a lot of things that are worth a lot more than money
you know and um
eh you know money does n't make the person
no
and it 's you know
so
that 's a weird- that 's that 's a weird question to be asking
yeah
uh-huh
what- what kind of question is that
you know i was like uh
um no
i would n't accept it either
i would not
you know i mean there 's bound to be other ways to make a million dollars
maybe to win the lottery or do something
but this
yeah
if you got to if y-
yeah
you ca- you ca n't buy a friend
you can not buy a friend not a real one
you know and i 've got one really good one that 's you know i 've had for like twenty years now
and uh
you know like no matter what happens she 's always there for me
always
you know and uh no
i- i could n't accept that
i could n't accept it either
i mean i-
no
you ca n't
and i- if you 're lucky enough in your lifetime to even have one friend then you- you 've done something you know because i mean most people go through life and not really have any real friends
yeah
i i the way i look at it i feel blessed to just have one really good one
you know
you know i mean it 's a blessing
and no
no
there 's no amount of money worth that
and i would n't even e- even if it was ten million i would n't accept it because th- you ca n't put a price on friendship
you just can not do it
where you from- where you from sean
los angeles
i talked to a lady the other night that was from los angeles
i 'm from panama city florida
yeah
yeah
this yeah
yeah
born and raised
well i was born in ohio raised in tampa and then transplanted up here about ten years ago
uh so i 've kind of been all over
i not a military brat or anything
but moving around a lot you did n't get a lot of really close acquaintances
but the one i met twenty years ago we have managed to stay really close
and if i need anything she 's there
and if she needs anything i 'm there
and there 's no price tag on that
there is absolutely no price tag
yeah
i 'm i 'm i 'm unfortunate there because we moved so many times when i was little that i do n't have any friends that go all the way back to my childhood
which i wish i did you know because i feel you know y- people that do have that are definitely more blessed and more fortunate than people that m- got moved around a lot like i did
but
yeah
well see we moved my- we moved from state to state uh city to city
uh
so i- i never really got to know- you know i got to to where i shut people out you know because i did n't you know what i 'm saying
yeah
because i just you know i did n't want to be hurt
i did n't you know i did n't want i did n't want to have to say goodbye you know because say- saying goodbye i think to me is one of the hardest things that there ever ever is to do
i think
i 'm sorry i think that has a lot to do with like uh just media coverage i guess
i do n't know
i think media coverage has a lot to do with people thinking that there 's more things wrong with s- schools than there really are i guess
like after all the
i do n't know like after all like the school shooting stuff people are always like all worried about the schools and stuff like that
but i-
yeah
pe- uh do you
what do think about like private schools
do you think they 're any better than public schools or anything
i mean like churche- i do n't know
right
yeah
is that all that you 're really basing it on is just test scores
or like how what 's wrong with the schools in california
right
oh
that 's weird
wow
is that because they 're kind of building it around like a standardized testing or something like the curriculum
or like
oh
right
so
so do you what do you think they could do like to fix it
i do n't know like other than just just straight up funding i guess is the only way you can really fix your california schools or your public schools there
huh
yeah
right
yeah
does a lot of the funding go into like technology stuff
or just like just the programs
because i know at our school it seemed like they 're always like needing money
but it seems like our school 's always buying like new tech- er new like technology things
for like the room or new computers and stuff
but i do n't know
is that that kind of a problem
or
what do you teach lower or higher level
wow
right
right
no one
like when you first started up there or whatever
yeah
that 's true
you kno- you know what
you 're right
i guess it y- depends on what you mean by wrong
like is it the you know the social problems that there 's a serious problem with
or is it the academic or both
um
yeah
y- i do n't know because i do n't know about like the test scores from private schools
but there 's a lot of um i guess emphasis put on test scores in um at least you know where i 'm from here in california
um it 's crazy
you know and i just i just think that um there 's more to life than testing
s- so but
yeah
but we 're definitely lowest in the nation when it comes to these test scores
well i guess um there 's a not enough funding
that 's kind of like the biggest thing for for sort of having a well rounded educational program because right
yeah
right now they 're so focused on um math and english that they really do n't e e actually at my elementary school where i teach they r- rarely have time to do science or social studies because it 's all about math and english and um you know raising the scores on that
so you know
yeah
it 's it 's really too bad
i think because those and also as you know or may have heard th- you know they do n't really have a lot of room for extra activities like music and even p. e.
if i
well kind- well i think it 's all based on funding because there 's not enough f- funding to um provide these other programs and also because there 's so many other things that that could you know be done at this time
but uh i think they 're just kind of putting all their eggs in one basket like okay
we have to just totally focus on reading and math because that 's the only way that we 're going to improve those scores
but there 's but see they do n't understand
the other subjects actually enhance that learning
you know
mm
well that 's i think that 's one way
um another way is to hey give teachers a little more freedom in the classroom because what they 're starting to do now is adopt these um like totally scripted they have this totally scripted program for reading
that 's like it 's like it- it 's already there
i mean teachers just follow along with this book
i m- i mean they could just be robots really
you know
but i- i think but i think that 's a general problem with a lot of big institutions that it 's really hard to avoid in that you have a lot of people to service and you need it to kind of be uh standard in what you 're providing
so you end up p- treating everybody as as like um not really as an individual
like uh everybody gets treated exactly the same
so but that 's a problem i ca n't really solve you know how to individualize education for two hundred kids when you have sixteen teachers
mm
well they um well actually technology 's a big focus
so they do have funding for that
um so that 's good
i mean a lot of this uh especially the the like the lowest performing schools in the poorest areas like they have the most technology
but i think i think their problem is it 's like there 's so much i- i mean exac- really if i could pinpoint one thing i would say that there 's very little support for the teachers
like you know when you have one teacher and thirty-seven students it 's very hard to um get that individualized instruction
and they hardly ever have like teacher aides
like maybe at the elementary school they have some
but a- at the higher levels no
well i 'm i actually am a computer teacher
so i 'm not a classroom teacher anymore
i 'm in i 'm in the computer lab
so i see everybody every day
but i 'm not like the regular classroom teacher
but i 've been there
and i and i see what goes on and you know every day
and i 'm just like oh wow
but i think it 's it 's more like just having more help and more support because you know usually in the lowest performing schools in the worst neighborhoods that 's where you get the most inexperienced teachers because that 's how a- i got thrown in
yeah
yeah
i mean and and it 's just another attempt
it i mean that 's that 's that 's what i believe affirmative action to be is that it 's attempt to see if another system works
i mean i 'm i 'm glad to see that something ha- is being done to a- try change or try some form of you know action to to make things better
basically i mean it 's
i am not sure about the background of it much
yeah
yeah
i mean and i mean personally i i work in retail
and i know that in o- almost all circumstances i- it does n't like affirmative action does n't even need to be applied be- considering all the bi-ethnic coworkers i have
and and almost in this case it 's it i i mean this is only from personal experience but most non like white american young boys like my age like they they do n't do work
and most employers are more likely to to hire someone else that 's older a w- maybe even a woman or bi-ethnic because because they are more productive
and uh i mean it in like that 's the other thing
it 's like another standard that is n't even applied
but but in like a work space like for example my mom she works an insurance company
she she 's been working there for some over a dozen years
and she 's t- e- hard working
she 's diligent all that
and she she 's making almost half of what m- men that have been working there for about two years have been are making already
i mean it 's just something that 's
i- it 's it 's something like affirmative action is perfect for situations like that
yeah
i mean i think uh if the that 's the only downfall to affirmative action is it 's also just saying well let 's set up a system so we can forget about it for a couple decades
like i mean it it 's and and it 's like i said it 's an attempt
but at the same time it 's also all right
well f- we got tha- where we 'll just say we finished and we cured that problem
but then we 'll just leave it and then see what everyone else says about it
it 's
exactly
yeah
to make that decision
e-
which th- i personally find ridiculous
but
that
y- yeah
i mean like i- i- i- that 's like education
that 's a life
like r- regardless of who you are you need an education of some sort
and i think that that
right
yeah
i mean i i i def- i see the pros and the cons
i think that if we had a uh a perfect society where you know if you fill applications you would n't even put your race on there and just go strictly by uh the qualifications and hire somebody off of that you know eh i would be really really interested to see how that turned out
yeah
i think in the spirit that it was created back in was it kennedy who u- started it
but i think that i think it was kennedy
and it was where he was pretty much saying that you know state and government and the universities almost were forcing the integration as far as
okay
we 've got to make sure these people get an opportunity to get in here
and with everything that 's evolved at this point i think we probably should be able to should n't have anything to be forced upon us to do that
but unfortunately we still got situations where people are kind of like the good old boy system is still in effect
and um you have some people who w- you know just want certain people in there
and they 're going to keep it the same all the way across the board
hm
right
right
mhm
right
mhm
right
right
but you would hope that somebody somewhere is looking at this and saying hey why are we paying her less
and this guy is y- uh they 're doing the same thing
right
because it looks like every uh ten or fifteen years it comes back up
you know it started in sixty-one and then early seventies
and then eh i think in ninety-eight when i think it was either eight n- or ninety-nine when they were looking at the whole school um the admission policies as far as schools are concerned
and i think it was of course california
you know they have every it 's like a whole nother w- country over there
but you know they got a- l- lu- ru- uh laws and rules that nobody else has
but i think the su-
yes
it was the supreme court um i- because it went all the way up there
they said that universities could use race as a factor ah with selecting students for admission
n- i and i do n't know the specifics behind you know that as far as why they ruled that they had to or or what even led to them coming up to that because you know th- a-
yeah
because i think they had abolished it at some point
and then and i do n't remember when because when i was in school i mean that was a factor
you know and then somewhere along the way they abolished it
and then it came back this year saying that uh y- they could use that as a factor to um selecting students for admission
so
i just think that you know especially when you 're talking about a university and a school
you know w- hey what did you make on the a. c. t.
yeah
yeah
yeah
you have to have uh like a good handful of differences
right
different kinds of people
yeah
absolutely
yeah
yeah
yeah
totally
so um um i mean i 've seen
i know i know there are certain kind of jobs though and stuff where only certain kind of people are going to hire certain other kinds of people
to me it 's very understandable though
yeah
i mean um you go to go to i 'm not going to go to apply for a job in a indian restaurant to cook
in a indian restaur-
well i mean in o- in other words like a an indian restaurant with um
you know let 's say it 's run by a whole family by an indian family
you think so
i like to laugh
so um where are you
where are you calling from
new york
really i 'm in i 'm in bo-
i 'm in boston
yeah
i used to live in manhattan
i love manhattan
and they 're working on it
right
i see
yeah
and then i 'll move back
but um
you mean the the the the people who 've left
oh in new york
mm
a lot of different kinds of people left
oh yeah
mhm
and what i-
right
oh
is it that serious
yeah
uh-huh
so what do you think
is it overall good t- worthwhile or bad
yeah
yeah
right
mhm
yeah
yeah
yeah
actually i w-
yeah
i do know
and actually i 've been in the i 've been in the low income bracket the lowest income bracket all my life pretty much
yeah
and i went to school in harlem too
i went to city the city college of new york
yeah
and and i loved being there
and i i saw i saw harlem before the gentrification began
yeah
yeah
yeah
it must be gorgeous
yeah
uh-huh
so is it strange
i mean like if if um
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
oh wow
oh a hundred twenty-fifth street was always so grey and dirty
oh
sure
that what makes the world go round
huh
it makes all it takes all different kind of people to make this world go round and function
it is
why
that 's some they ai n't going to hire you anyway
no
why are you laughing david
yeah
that 's nice
i 'm calling from new york
manhattan
where you at
wow
yeah
well you know how they fixing it up
right
honey the the work is almost about completed
another two or three years
well that 's what they all doing
and it 's making it hard for the people already here too
bu- well understand this
what people left
yeah
i 'm i 'm not talking about new york
i 'm talking about manhattan harlem
yeah
a lot of white people are moving into harlem now
they build up a lot of these buildings that were abandoned almost thirty forty years
they build them up
and they getting rid of a lot of the people that used to live in this community a long time
yeah
it 's that serious
but they are but they are building it up to make it a beautiful place
you know
well y- well you know um to an extent it 's worthwhile
if people was treated fairly i think it would be worthwhile
understand it 's a studio apartment costs eleven hundred dollars
that do n't even include light and gas
and not too many black people can afford that
not at the rate that they they working and the jobs they work on
most of them m- most money t- most of um their money goes on the rent and con edison
you know
uh-huh
yeah
what school
wow
that 's nice
oh
w-
oh my god then
and so you know what a m- mess it was in
right
so you need to see it now baby
it 's beautiful out here
all the abandoned buildings and everything are built up
built up
about to get ready to build a few hotels here too
nothing but condos and condominiums all over the place
yeah
yeah
it 's strange
it 's strange for me
i been here all my life
those buildings been tore up forty years
where 'd they get the money to build them at now
and then like i said all these white people in the community
do n't get me wrong
it 's for everybody
but then it 's getting it 's it 's beginning to be for uh for people with money
it used to be a poor community
now it 's basically for the rich
everything they building up the
right there on hundred twenty-fifth street they got just about everything they had downtown is up here
yeah
no
babe you ai n't seen it yet
we 've got everything on twenty-fifth street
i mean my sound system is probably almost even better than the sound system they have in movie theaters
i kind of saved up for a while
but you ca n't you ca n't beat that big picture
yeah
uh-huh
and i 'm watching t. v. right now
and i 'm about to watch a movie
but i ca n't get it
no
i guess there a channel i just do n't get
let 's see
oh
they 're so high
they 're so high
it 's a rip off
what is it
like twenty bucks at least
spend thirty bucks for two people to go see a movie with snacks
what 's that
no
no way
i live in an expensive ass area of town
there 's no way anything like that could survive out here
no
i w- i do n't know
there 's i do n't know
there 's some movies out there that i 'd i 'd easily pay for though
you know like when the new matrix comes out i 'd easily pay for that one or the new lord of the rings
but you know since the ticket prices went up so much i just do n't go see like if movies
you know
it 's like i always go in t-
yeah
you know i do n't know
and then for me i do n't have a car
so it 's kind of a pain in the butt to get to the movie theater
that 's kind of a pain in the butt
yeah
there 's a mov- there 's a movie rental place down the block
and i got a d. v. d. player
and i got an awesome sound system
that 's kind of nice because when you watch them at home you can like lay in bed
what 's that
hello
what was that
yeah
you can lay down
but there 's this one theater
it 's eh it 's called the bridge cinema de lux
it 's uh they have leather like lay z. boy type seating
yeah
it 's a little extra
you got to pay extra to see movies in the theaters there
and it 's and it 's stadium seating
i think it 's like sixteen bucks a ticket
but it 's so comfortable
it 's so comfortable
i did it once to see what it was like
it is so comfortable
i th- i thought it was
it was an extra four bucks
i thought it was worth it
it was so comfortable
plus i ge- i get to see movies for free also
my dad worked in the industry
i live in l. a. by the way
yeah
yeah
my dad worked my dad
oh
yeah
not out here
no
those are pretty nice
that would make them even nicer though
to do one thing i would like stadium seating which is nice
so like you h- you never have to worry about someone 's head being in front of you because you 're up like a whole like half a foot above them
you know
which is pretty nice
i sometimes wish they had it in every theater
what 's that
i 've never really had that
only t- at the beginning of the movie
i never had an experience when people did that the whole movie through
yeah
i never saw that in the theater
uh-uh
yeah
i almost never went to the theater until i started dating a girl a while ago
and then i started going again
i probably did n't even see a movie for years
mm mm
not at all
no matter how big your screen is at home
it does n't match
ah
you ca n't get it
what is it pay per view
oh
hm
what do you think about movie prices
i think it 's ridiculous
yeah
yeah
yea-
yeah
two of you
mhm
um do you have a dollar theater where you live
do you have a dollar theater where you live
oh
okay
hm
hm
hm
oh
yeah
yeah
oh
yeah
you definitely have to you have to judge which ones are worth it and which ones are n't
it yeah
so it 's a special occasion when you go huh
and like you can get laxed-
yeah
i 'm sorry
i 'm sorry
i said you can get more relaxed
mhm
on all the seats
w- how much is a ticket
oh gosh
ah there 's no way
was it worth your sixteen bucks
uh-huh
oh
okay
mm
how was it
oh
okay
oh
okay
mm
i 'm all the way in north carolina
i know that movie theaters have come a long way from what they used to be
they used to be real nasty and dirty
and i mean there are still some out there
but on a whole they 're a lot better
no
mhm
you know the way
uh-huh
um i think that 's the most annoying thing
i think the most annoying thing is going to the theater and having like so much interruption like noise and people that are hooting and hollering
yeah
they usually taper off
but i do n't know like when um the blair witch project came out yeah
that movie theater was so loud and so alive
you did n't
mm that movie was spooky when it first came out because everybody thought it was real
really
oh really
yeah
do you play against other people
oh yeah
oh
that 's cool
yeah
yeah
y- y- y- just what like check in what they say
but you do n't say anything
yeah
yeah
it is
i know
now are the people that you play also in california
or are they like from all over
really
oh
wow
that would be interesting to chat with those people
oh
cool
yeah
yeah
cool
no
actually i d- i did another one
and actually um one of them i like you can dial in for them
and i dialed in
well one time that worked
i i dialed in because they sent me an email with my pin number
so i dialed in
and it i you know put in my pin number and everything
and then they put me on hold to look for another participant
well it was like ten minutes
and so i hung up
and then i called back later that night to see you know to try to do it again
well it would n't let me
and so it was like i had reached my quota of three calls
but then i got called again tonight
which i was n't expecting at all
so they must have realized they 'd never completed that one
and and they put it aga- in again
yeah
so is this your first one
yeah
yeah
well and just like you can get it out of the way
you know instead of waiting for them to call you you just go and do it
yeah
what was your other question that you answered
i did um would you uh commit perjury ever
yeah
to leave the
to leave the united states
oh
see now the one i tried to call in was uh to take a million dollars to leave the country
and i that was the one that that i got put on hold
and then i did n't get to answer it
so
so did would you take the million dollars
how 'd you answer that one
yeah
yeah
yeah
well no
no
unfortunately
yeah
really
yeah
and it was to never never see or talk to your best friend again
see i could never do that because i talk to my best friend she 's actually in kentucky
and i talk to her all the time
so i i could n't survive without calling her
there 's no way i could take it with
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
i know
now the p- the perjury question was a- an immediate- both of us said immediately we were like no
we would n't do that
and then we were like well what if it was like your son and you know your child
and they were
you know like y- w- the- i- circumstances were that if if you did n't commit perjury then they 'd like be put away for a really long time
and if they just happe- you know it was accidental that they were in the situation
you know so we started justifying ways that you could make it
hah but computer games is kind of easy compared to those
yeah
yeah
right
right
yeah
yeah
i have a neighbor that plays computer games too
and i always wondered as i 'm sure he probably does it on uh you know free sites and stuff
he plays one game that he 's really into
um i 've never really i 've kind of played computer games but not over the internet
i 've never do- i 've never checked into that at all
i was kind of wondering about it
you know i mostly just play on a site called pogo
it 's you know it 's all free
and they 've got solitaire and blackjack and n- just kind of different fun kind of games
the only thing
yeah
for some of the games like there 's hearts and spades you can set up the the room so that you 're playing against the computer if you do n't want to play with other people
but then you can play with other people if you want to also
um and then there 's always chat and if you want to chat
and i do n't really do that much
um but it 's interesting to see what some of the people will say
right
and i 'm like okay
that was a little personal information that the probably rest of the group did n't need to know
so it 's kind of funny what people will uh share anonymously
yeah
they 're they 're everywhere
i mean there 's people from you know china and australia and all over the globe
so that 's kind of fun to
there was somebody
yeah
there was somebody who was from australia who i actually d- chatted a little bit with because they were in a near a city b- where i had been last year
and so that was kind of fun to say oh my god i 've been there
so
yeah
now is this your first call
or have you had a couple calls
yeah
how is that
how does that work
like you can i-
uh-huh
right
oh
oh
int-
no
this is my second one
but i was wondering how the call in thing works
so like if you do n't think you 're going to be around you can call in
and do your call as a oh that 's kind of cool
oh
that 's a good idea
what was the question
oh
um mine was would you take a million dollars and then never s-
and never s-
oh
no
to um and never speak to your best friend again
got it
and what would you have said
you know it was interesting because the woman that i was talking with um was like no
my gosh you know you could n't do that
and i was thinking like you know a- and and i would like to think that i would n't do that
but i think when it comes down to brass tacks you never know what you 're going to do
so i kind of said well i think that i- i would like to think that i would n't do that um because a million dollars w- while it 's not small peanuts it 's not it 's not going to take care of you for the rest of your life
and um i think she thought i was she 's like well i i certainly would n't
like it would n't even i- cross her mind that
so it was kind of funny
and then i
yes
exactly
so
yeah
right
right
well and i think that i mean i feel the same way
i 've got a couple really close friends
and i thought god what if i never could talk to them again
um you know but i think y-
yeah
and i and i think that 's probably the way i would go
but i still think that i 'd think about it
you know what i mean
so
right
right
seriously
well i wonder if there 's other ones that are kind of along those same lines that are a little more serious
and y- you know and i 'm sure they 'd probably figure out or you know they 're trying to determine how people how much people will disclose or not disclose or um whatever
so
right
it 's i- i- when i used to eh you know i had a couple computer games
um but
y- y-
where would people go
and for how long
you know it 's like e- even if i wanted to panic m- how would i react
would i leave town
would i buy food
would i hide in my cellar
right
i mean there 's so many different types of attacks that a- i do n't think y- you can really adequately prepare yourself uh other than common sense stuff
you know
right
yeah i mean i think w- we probably have a an exaggerated sense of uh risk when it comes to terrorist attacks
i think mm we 're probably more likely to die of snake bite or something
well no
you know we 're scared of snakes too
so
um
ah right
i think he 's using it as a convenient excuse to do what he wants to do politically
uh
mhm
right
right
and um i almost had a i mean a- i kind of hesitate to think it 's a i want to fa- finish what my father did sort of thing
but at the same time you know r- remember we created osama
and we created saddam
when when saddam invaded iran it was because a religious leader had overtaken iran er the ayatollah khomenei and was reversing the westernization of their culture and was less friendly to us
and so we supported saddam to go attack him
we gave him all the weapons
we gave him the chemical weapons
and then uh at the same time w- we you know und- behind the scenes we were giving weapons to iran to fight iraq with
you know it 's like wait a minute
you know we 're we 're playing both sides of it and and trying to be the moral crusaders at the same time
and you know it 's i do n't know the rest of the world kind of sees our our duplicity
but but most americans do n't
i was astonished at the poll that came out that said that people that watched fox news believed that n- the terrorists i- w- from nine eleven came from iraq that saddam was supporting them that al qaeda 's based there that you know it 's like all this stuff that 's patently false
and i could n't believe that so many people believed it
right
yeah
they 're just all trying to make more out of it than it is i think
ah
right
and tha- e- a- an- and i think it 's a little weird that we 're going to cough up millions of dollars you know each for p- people that died there
but i- i- in all of these other events where we 've been attacked by by suicide bombers you know the marines you know over in the middle east and stuff like that
those people get nothing
you know if you
right
d- right
if you die in the e- e- you know as a result of a a street crime or you know something like that you get nothing
ah you know if you work hard all your life but you do n't have health insurance tough luck
you know but we 're going to reward people that died there
you know it just seems a little selective to me
i do n't know i d- i did see i do n't i do n't feel any safer at the airports
right
women 's heels have metal in the middle
i was wearing
i- i was wearing a really p- soft pair of shoes with no socks
you know it 's like g- they were almost like moccasins almost
and they scanned them
and then they scanned my bare feet
where do you think i 'm hiding something here folks
you know and it was like with a metal detector on my bare feet
it was n't a chemical sniffer
you know
exactly
yeah
because you do n't know where exactly is safe
so
yeah
yeah
you could n't even be at home and receive a mail
and you know
there 's something in that mail that can affect you
okay
yeah
but how do you feel um you know bush is handling everything
mm that i i honestly feel it 's uh something personal because you know with with saddam i mean everybody i i i thought you know osama bin laden was the person that they 're supposed to be looking for
and all of a sudden i hear you know saddam
you know and i 'm like you know this is something personal
it 's what his father did n't get to do
he 's trying to finish it off
mhm
exactly
exactly
yeah
mhm
mhm
exactly
yeah
yeah
yeah
exactly
it 's just
hm
it was just like in
the thing is that right after september eleventh it 's like it 's it just became like a joke to some people
you know they they want to send you emails online
oh did you see the smoke
it looks like satan 's face
it look like santa 's face
you know it 's just like
yeah
right
and they do n't realize that they 're affecting the people that lost you know because i have a um a family member who lost her a uh best friend in the world trade center
so
exactly
yup
y- yeah
and they 're they 're the ones fighting for us
hm
hm
i know
i i 've um i ended up going out of state last month
and i was just like i was just going crazy
you know i b- i did n't have any metal objects
but the shoes that i had on had something
i do n't know they said it ha- it has carries a metal
yeah
so um you know i got stopped
and you know all these people 's looking at me
and
but i i i was glad that they did that because i 'm like you know at least i know
yeah
there was a woman that they stopped
i think she had like a metal plate or something on her knee cap
and they kept scanning it
she keeps telling them there 's you know
um i 'm out in california
so oh no
it had n't really
i do n't think it really affected me personally besides
i do n't know m- media
ah did it affect you personally
yeah
yeah
yeah
like right after nine eleven happened a friend of or my friend 's parents owned a uh deli
and they were of some arab descent
and they ended up getting their windows broken out
like yeah
and i do n't know it just seems immediately after everyone kind of i do n't know their true colors and emotions kind of surged forth
like
yeah
it seems i do n't know people uh do n't really
it 's not based in fact like people 's reactions to things at all
it 's more straight emotion
like i just took a plane a couple weeks ago
and like they searched me three times like i do n't know for d- i do n't know looking kind of scummy
but like it just seemed kind of bizarre that like i do n't know really appearance matters now
and
yeah
yep
yeah
same thing with me
like oh boy
yeah
yeah
my girlfriend was over in europe when nine eleven happened
and i guess like she was telling me about it was just completely bizarre experience to be over there
i
yeah
i i agree
like
totally
if you think about nine eleven and stuff i mean nobody knows like what 's going on
and the only information you receive is from the media
and i mean it can be misconceiving and stuff
and um i do n't know i do n't think i can talk for ten minutes about it
um where where are you from
like has anything like affected you personally or anything
eh okay
i 'm over on the east coast
so
um not not really just because i never like knew anyone i was like to- like directly involved with anything or affected by it
i mean i remember like i 'm at school
and i remember like with like nine eleven or whatever like everybody at school 's like what 's going on
you know like what 's happening
so i was just like panic and stuff
and mm i guess even now when i go to get on a plane i think like oh is you know or i- is someone else going to come on
like mm
i do n't know have something with them like some kind of weapon or something i guess
u uh i do n't kn-
mhm
really
yeah
yeah
i absolutely
it 's kind of too bad because like you ca n't help it
but i mean even like i have to admit even now like if i 'm somewhere you know and like there 's a lot of like arabs or something or w- like when i i travel kind of a lot
and when i do and i like go and i get in a plane and if there 's someone of like arab descent like i ca n't help but like my first concern is oh my god like are they you know like going to do something
and i feel so bad for like thinking that
but just it 's kind of hard not to like when that 's like the only like exposure i 've had is like you know like whatever you hear on the news and stuff and because i do n't really have like i guess a very diverse group of friends
but i do n't know
yeah
oh
eh yeah
yeah
oh yeah
absolutely
but i still like i feel like g- like i 've seen like young teenage girls or whatever like searched in the airports
and i 'm thinking to myself like what are they going to have on them
but now it 's like you do n't know like you do n't know who they 're with and stuff
and i do n't know
but i guess that 's the way everything is now
i do n't know
so
yeah
i did n't know i was going to be talking to like a complete stranger
i had no clue
my friend 's just like oh call this number
you get money
i was like okay
so well i gue- i studied abroad actually
and that was the first time like that i got to experience like e- being like an american from like a foreign point of view
you know like people would like always bring up stuff about the war and stuff
and like i had some people come up to me like oh like you 're an american
like we do n't like you and stuff
and it was weird to like have that like you know step out of um i do n't know like seeing everything from like somebody else 's point of view and stuff
so i guess that kind of like altered my opinion on everything that 's been going on
but
yeah
yeah
because you have some people that e- like support and other people that do n't
and it 's just
i do n't know it was weird because like when i i was in australia
and it 's like at the i would meet people
and the first thing they would say to me is oh so what 's your opinion about the war
and i 'm just like i was like i do n't want to talk about that while i 'm over here
like i do n't know
yeah
mhm
um
yeah
i would probably do the same thing
like if i were on a plane i probably would attack them before they attacked me
like i do n't know that would be the first thing i 'd do
i 'd just be like i do n't know first thing i 'd do like if they sit there like okay
i 'm going take over the plane i 'd probably just like tackle them
but if like um if attack yeah
i i think i 'd i 'd panic
i don- i do n't know
yeah
i think y- i do n't know i 'd probably have like a panic attack or something and just be like stuck frightened
mhm
can get upset
i can get pissed off
i could sit there
and i can cry
oh i could throw stuff at the terrorists
i do n't know
it was something like um
i do n't know
how would you react if it w- to a panic a- um a terrorist attack
i think that was what it was
yeah
well how would you react to a pa- a a terrorist attack
uh-huh
if it happened
if i got a- attacked in my neighborhood what by some terrorists
um
first things first i would have to get the little kids as far away as possible
um let 's see call the police
that would probably be a good idea
um let 's see i do n't know i 'd probably call the news
i 'd probably call everybody
just
like i 'll just be like the tattle tale
i 'll just be on the phone just calling everybody because if you 're getting attacked by terrorists and if you 're like if you see what 's going on it 's probably not too many
you do n't know if like a whole bunch of people are watching or if you 're the only one that sees what 's going on
you want to get as many people as possible to know about it
what would you do
like it was just announced on the news there 's been another terrorist attack
yeah
and also if i found out there was like a terrorist attack like on the news or something i 'd still have to like call family because i know that they travel a lot
you never know if they go through that area
and like one of them could be in the hospital or something
you still got to you know make sure st- of stuff like that because you know one of them could be in the hospital
and nobody sat there and you know identified them or whatever
yeah
most definitely
i do n't know what i 'd do actually
how do i feel about the war
anyway okay so
i definitely think i would panic just because it 's natural that if you 're being hurt or somebody around you 's being hurt my first reaction would be to run right
or something
so def-
really
oh
oh
oh
oh
okay
i see
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
i think if i was in that situation i would i would try to do that
but i think i would be really scared
i do n't know
it 's hard to tell
i g-
huh
something
i do n't know i definitely d- could say a lot
but who knows
yeah
i do n't know i 'd probably just be
i do n't know what i would do honestly
um what was the other part of the question
how do you feel
and what would you do i think or something
anyway
what
yeah
and i think how do you feel was i do n't know
i do n't know
i was n't really listening
that 's not good
okay
so how would you feel if it happened
yeah
or
yeah
yeah
hm
yeah
i do n't know
um if a terrorist attack t- happened
i do n't know i would probably call my family first
i do n't know
it 's weird
eh it depends on like where when like
if i was at work i do n't know i 'd probably
i do n't know what i a- honestly i do n't know
it 's too hard
now that if it was n't close to home i i would just i would be just sympathetic if it was if it if it hurt anybody which i think that 's whole point of a terrorist attack
but if it happened like to family and stuff like that no
i would just probably go crazy
yeah
i 'd be really sad
oh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
i do n't know it 's hard it 's really hard to tell for me when
like
it would have to i 'd have to get more detail about when and where it was i would be at
or i guess
but i definitely if it happened to me i definitely would be worried
and and
i am
anyway so what how do you feel about the war itself
yeah
because they have stories
but whether they 're black anything with a good plot and a good that has character development i prefer
right
uh-huh
right
mhm
they do n't seem to be s- spending as much time as acting in the films as playing in the films if that makes sense to you
the people are pretending to act
but they 're n- they 're letting everything else around them act for them
mhm
right
mhm
no
i have n't
mhm
okay
right
okay
well there 's some films th- that you do n't kno- you u- do n't fi- e you e like because they make you think
but they 're not enjoyable f- films because they make you think about things that you try to avoid most of the time
is that one the kinds of films
mhm
right
mhm
well um one of the best films although it has no real actors in there it 's voice act- finding nemo
see it
well not only that
it has a lot of value in d- what it teaches people teaches kids
it has a great story line
it 's what they 're missing in all the other ones
even though it has animation it has all the characteristics you describe in the ol- in the older films in a car- in an animation
oh
okay
mhm
well i 've i 've talked to more adults who have seen it more than once than the kids
right
and the adults are buying it
i already have the disney collection
but other adults who do n't b- buy films are buying this
mhm
because it is very high quality um unlike a- charlie 's angels
or anyone who 's actually saw a lot of these movies in the theater would never think of buying them the ones that are coming out all the action ones
mhm
oh
i p- i wo n't pay
i 'll maybe do it in a de- on uh rent it on a d. v. d.
but i wo n't pay for it in the theater
but i have had people like dates or friends pick a movie
and we have to go see those
and i 'm just like okay
you 're paying right
i 'm not paying for this
like i- this is not out of my pocket
right
this is like i 'm sorry
i refuse to support this
but
mhm
no
oh
of course
oh
absolutely
the um the o- the classics i mean they 're just the best
i mean all those i mean wh- what 's m- much more fun than t- than all um all what was it all about eve with bette davis
i mean these m- in these films you know the all the you know joan crawfords and lana turner and oh they 're just they 're just wonderful
uh jean tierney in laura
oh they 're just wonderful
um
uh well
well yeah
i mean that 's th- that 's those adventure sci- you know uh uh special effects that you do n't really have to have actors like because everything else is done for them
um i did see a s- a screening of a film on saturday that i think is really
e i thought it was excellent
um have you heard of the h- the film the human stain
oh my god it 's it 's uh anthony hopkins
gary sinise
it 's it 's one of those films that
very thought provoking
uh it has a s- um it has a s- s- oh a story to it
um it 's uh the the dialogue the writing everything is just a cut above what you usually see
and i i st- i rement- i recommend seeing it because it will at least make you think
i mean i happen to have liked the film
and i thought that it was one of anthony hop- hopkins ' best performances
but
no
i mean n- not i mean you know i i like to go to the movies and be entertained
but i also like to be entertained with good quality film- filming
and i just i just do n't think that the caliber of movie making these days is is up to par
and and this film came along
it 's just like a
i mean i have a- i just i enjoy really good movie making
you know i have n't seen it
and i want to see it
i heard it 's adorable
mhm
mhm
right
yes
i 've heard that
and i uh actually i 'm kind of waiting for it to come on cable
but i do want to see it
i 've heard so many good things about it
mhm
is n't that something
yeah
yeah
i 've heard wonderful wonderful things about it
mhm
yeah
see i just i do n't really i- i just do n't have
a- my taste does n't really go in that kind of f- film films
i
i- i like i am not going to go pay money to see drew barrymore and
wha-
yeah
i just they they just don- i saw the first one
it came on cable
if i see them on cable then i 'll see them
yeah
you 're pay-
exactly
yeah
yeah
i saw another s- another film
it was uh it 's a little independent
it 's just lovely
it 's called the station agent
i do n't know if you 've heard of it
it 's just lovely
it 's um
are you oh so you 're fairly uh limited uh be- how how your personal views can be expressed in your teaching
i end up doing that too much myself
i end up uh cause difficulty at at work situations uh because i a- am more pointed
and and if people will draw me out you know i i i 'm not uh as as hesitant
and um pe- you know then p- and people can read uh direct answers the wrong way
just as easily as uh they can read things into you they can make
eh it just depends on how they 're raised and what their what the tolerance is for somebody else
but i i i onl- lived where i 've been for about little over two months though
i hardly know anybody and s- and do n't have any real reason
i i i 've been in another part of florida
but i i moved in to a closer to a college campus uh about two months ago
i i 've been in the state for since the first of the year but was basically isolated in a very small town uh the first half of the year
right
i 'm i 'm i 'm not li- exactly originally from there
but i 'm a military kid
so i 'm not from anywhere
right
and some people find that kind of neat and fascinating that i get to th- you know ah uh you get to
well what the way i look at it is w- uh i did n't get to choose
and uh if i had it to choose from the beginning i would 've had to ha- i would 've had like parallel lives
i would 've had an opportunity to go and you know have this kind of vagabond life and and have new situations like b. j. and the bear kind of thing
and at the same time i would 've had a life that would 've had some continu- continuity to it and you know being consistent in one in in one place
you know i could go back to i just tried to contact somebody from high school i- just the other day
and it 's amazing you know that it fifteen something years has gone by already
and uh i can hardly keep track of anybody uh that was there um ye- uh eh moving as much as i have
and some of them moved too
uh i-
no
i 'm not limited in how my personal views can be expressed
it 's just that i usually i do n't usually ah open up th- other than other than in in generalities
bu- i don- i 've i do n't open up in in specifics ah with people other than those that i know well and uh i guess i 'm i 'm going to say trust
but i 'm not sure if i if that 's the correct word to use
but um when i know a person and and the- and get the feeling for them and th- and and vice versa they understand me and get a feeling for me and that i feel that i can open up and communicate with them m- more and that they care more as far as about what i 'm saying as opposed to uh just talking to somebody that i see occasionally and that and trying to uh ex- express or give my ideas uh in mo- in i guess you could say uh in in detail and that
i you know a- they ask me like how are things are going at work
and then i 'll say eh you know things are going fine
i 'm enjoying it and this and that
but if i- if it 's a person that i ah know an- and knows me better than that then i w- i k- i kind of would go into detail as far as uh you know what it was that that that 's going on that 's great work
or if i 'm having difficulties or problems and that uh you know what i should uh m- what i think
or what i w- or m- i might even ask for uh advice or an opinion from them
whereas i- as it 's just someone that i do n't know that well you know b- but i mean i they 're they 're acquaintances i guess you could say i do n't uh i do n't open up that much to them
an- and i do n't really seek their uh advice or their ah thoughts on the ideas that that much
right
now this is in florida
okay
were y-
were you from virginia or ah was it virginia you say you were going to see about possibly going to
okay
and you 're you 're un- unfortunately you 're from a lot of different pl- i i do n't mean that in a bad way
ah uh but d- you never had a lot of roots set down for the most part
it depends on on on how you feel about it your personality
if you like to meet a lot of different people then that 's fine if you 're going all over and that
but if you
hm
right
yeah
even for myself it 's been longer than that
but there are some some ah friends that it uh i 've that i 've had in high school that i do n't keep real close in touch with
but you know every few years ah i 'll give somebody a call and see how things are going and that
or t- or they 'll give me a call and that
and ah once in a while i do see people that you know that i did go to school with and that
e- but ah
yeah
it 's it seems like our l- uh li- lives today and e- in so- to some degree even like i guess you could say friendships today
ah a lot of my friends i do a lot of the contacting and calling to
ah the- uh and and these are ones that are n- we 're not necessarily real close to
but i do try to keep and even sometimes with family and that ah you do n't hear from peop- you know aunts uncles or cousins and that in the family
with the programming they had put that
i i do n't know if you ever seen that elimidate
oh man
they put this on right after the kids come home from school
and to me it should be like an r. rated show because it was like a guy would get to take four girls out
or a girl would get to take four guys out
and she would have to eliminate them from a date
and uh some of it was pretty what i consider vulgar and stuff that you just should not do in public
but they put it on right after school
and i thought now how stupid are they
most parents work
and they put this kind of programming on in the afternoon after school
no
uh yeah
tha-
yeah
yup
well we um like to let them watch like nickelodeon
and uh they really like disney
but
um i have a seven year old
she 'll well no
yeah
she 's my middle one
then i have a one that 'll be ten in two weeks
and i have a two year old
yeah
but even i noticed some of the nickelodeon programming is not that great i mean violence wise
pretty much sponge bob is pretty violent
i mean
yeah
mhm
yeah
it 's uh i i think there they really need to do something
well actually i do n't think it should be up to the the t. v. censors
it 's up to the parents
m- exactly
i do
i sit down
and i do my hom- thei- well my homework their homework
yeah
no
mine did n't either
and if there was a show on she thought we should n't be watching we were you know told to turn it
no
no
i do n't i think they they do need to do something
i know our we have s- a satellite system
and we can block out things we do n't want them to watch
and then we can unlock it
like if we do n't want them watching lifetime because sometimes some some movies on there are geared towards violence
and i really do n't want my kids to see that
if i 'd have it on
yeah
yeah
i agree there
that and some of the situations that go on in
mhm
yeah
yeah
i think t. v. shows have a lot to do with that though too because i know they have cartoons that the guys carry weapons
and the little kids think that 's cool
and it 's not i mean
it 's not that i do n't like my kids to think that you know protecting themself is n't an okay thing
but
no
mm
really
oh
yeah
yeah
it 's like blind date
i know the show that i 'm thinking of
it 's like blind date
yeah
i mean it 's you know what it was
it 's supposed to have been just clean f- fun where they were just dating
and they pick the one they liked the most
but you know something
it 's not our our population anymore
people are a lot more wild than that unfortunately
so
yeah
they they
i do n't know i also th- i happen to think t- some of these shows that are supposed to be geared towards kids are very violent
i mean they 're meant for little kids
and they 're very violent
and i said you know why do they have these shows
i mean they have cartoons that are violent
mm
are they very young
oh
so they are young
yeah
oh
is it
see i i do n't have any children
so i 'm never watching the children 's show
i just hear people talking
like i know who sponge bob is
and
but if
it is up to the parents
that is true
it 's definitely up to the parents
and i think parents need to get much more involved
like when we w- grew up it 's you know they did n't need to get involved as much
or you know something
maybe they 'd should 've gotten more involved because we grew up our parents were n't involved
now from what i hear the parents have to do the homework with their kids
in fact i 've heard other parents say that we have homework tonight
when i grew up my mother never did homework with me
this is not something that happened
yeah
it 's just very different
but the shows were n't as bad i do n't think when we were growing up as they are now
now it 's gotten re- everything is very risque
it amazes me that what 's on regular t. v.
it amazes me
i said i ca n't believe this stuff 's on regular t. v.
hm
i do n't blame you
there 's enough violence in this world
they do n't need to see any more
yeah
they 're very ris- i mean t. v. has gotten very risque this day these days
i mean i do n't have the kids
but if i had the kids i do n't know what i would do because it really is
it 's scary when they turn on the t. v.
my sister started an experiment
he- my nephew just turned ten
and they actually had the she the t. v. t- cut off for ten days
actually was it ten
d- no
i 'm sorry
i take that back
a whole month she actually had no t. v. service
so for a month they could not watch any t. v.
and she was trying to get him to read more
i mean and it but then it started with the video games
could n't watch t. v. then he wanted the video games
and he at ten years old has a very violent nature which i do n't like
like everything is a sword
and she 's not happy with it
everything he finds is a sword
oh
god
yeah
yeah
i saw a little bit of it
yeah
i mean tha- that was intr- that was n't well i do n't know the part voting out was kind of weird
but um but i mean just the comedy part is kind of an interesting on that
yeah
i saw it
i saw that they would wi- win at the end
that was really good
he was
he was really funny
yeah
i liked that
yeah
i liked him
yeah
i liked that a lot because i really like to watch e- singing and and all that anyway
so that 's why i really liked that
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i know
i know
i know
that 's all their choice
so that 's what they want to do
and
i mean
yeah
i mean so- on some of them they y- they get really bad reputations from them
and i mean
yeah
it 's totally their choice
so that 's why i do n't se- i do n't feel like it 's that bad watching them and watching things happen to them
and what image if they you know their choice to do whatever they do or their did things in the past or whatever
it 's all them
it 's not like anybody 's making them do anything at all
yeah
and that 's their choice
oh god
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
that 's pretty funny though
i mean and what 's sad about that i think though when they show all the bad people
how i mean i mean how awful would it be if you 're one of those people that they make fun of so bad
that 's so awful
i mean i 'm sure some of them are probably do- maybe they 'll go in there
and they kind of know maybe that they 're not going to make it
and they they just want to be on t. v.
but people that are really serious and then they 're all like so bad
that 's re- that 's pretty sad
but it 's funny though
it is it 's just so so funny
yeah
that 's what i was saying
yeah
i know
i know
that 's the worst part
i know
i know
it is
but it 's so funny
i mean you just e they you know that 's just like a comedy show when they have those
it 's just so funny
uh-huh
i know
i know
and they 're like the worst singer ever
and you know they just everybody 's making fun of them
i know
i know
but that 's all them too
i mean how can they think that they 're so good when they 're so bad
it 's just kind of weird
yeah
i know
or that 's all they maybe or maybe they never sang to anybody else that they just kind of think they 're good for some reason
and
that 's funny
that 's so funny
yeah
there 's a whole
but let me see what other
yeah
i know
yeah
but a lot of the shows too like some of th- some of them even the the worst ones like uh the bachelor or whatever
you know i mean like i kind of get sucked into watching like the first one
and once you start watching it it 's you ca n't stop
i mean you just got to see what happens to the end
like eh there 's just no way i can stop after i just kind of get into one of them
you just get addicted to it
wait
so they mostly watch fear factor or what
uh-huh
i know
that 's right
the fear factor one is the worst with that
i never watch that too much
and i mean
tha- yes
and i i do like some of them that were n't so much reality t. v.
but like the last comedian standing
did you ever see that
the now that was
yeah
and did you see the winner the vietnamese guy
uh i mean he had my vote anyway
i thought he was the best
did you like him
and then oh what was that other one um american idol
now those
yeah
i mean watching things where people are n't out being lied to and watching things where e you know people are enjoying themselves
and like um
uh that comedian one and the singers i liked those two
but other ones you know like um joe millionaire where all these women are being lied to
i mean i 'd marry you too if you told me you were a millionaire
i think we all would
you know but no one makes us go on those t. v. shows
they all e-
yeah
they want to
i- e-
yeah
yes
no one 's putting a gun to their head
and i kind of admired like uh american idol where they had to stand in line with you know a th- h- hundred thousand people and you know two or three or four days uh uh w- just standing in line
you know i admired that where you know d- y- you have a chance you know a million in one chance to become m- a famous singer
so that was kind of cool
oh yes
all those people making fools of themselves
i think some of them knew they were b-
i- it was funny
but but um i think some of them knew they were bad
and they just wanted to get on t. v.
but but what 's sad is some of them thought they were good
some of them thought sh- they should win
that was the pathetic part
it 's like dude you 're retarded
uh when the- i mean they were serious
oh yeah
i think i 'm really good
and i think i should win
and then you know
and to go home and have your friends see this that you 're retarded
i know
i kn-
they either do n't have any friends or their friends have lied to them because before i do anything stupid i always ask
y- you 're because i i 've had friends who think they 're really good
and it 's like y- you 're not
you stink
they 're not good
i know that
i mean when i want to do something i always ask friends is this stupid
will i make a fool of myself
and they go yes
do n't do it
you 'll make a fool of yourself
y- you know i-
but
but they want people the only reason it 's on the air is because we all watch it
everybody watches it
i mean even i watched th-
i thought it was stupid
but i watched it
yeah
yeah
that 's what my roommates were l-
that 's what my roommates were like
it 's like i had to leave just because of like oh no
um we have to unplug the phone
we ca n't talk to anybody because you know fear factor 's on
so i just left
i went to the library or went to see friends because like they 're like addicted
they 've become you know t- t. v. addicts watching this junk
oh
they en- liked they loved fear factor
they loved joe millionaire
and when they watched you know amer- last comedy standing i would watch that
and when they w- watched american idol
but these other ones i do n't want to sit and watch someone make a fool of themselves or you know eating eating some disgusting uh stuff from a dead animal and then watching them puke
oh
eh b- a bigger benefit
yeah
see that a lot
no
right
it it 's tough to uh tell people that they ca n't have children
but um if you do n't have the money to support your children you really should n't be having children
you know
exactly
mhm
yeah
it do- it does work out like that a lot
so
right
it 's a little bit of a head start a little bit of a um a chance to get something going
but you actually have to work at it
and you got to come up with something
right
is a- there 's a lot of people on welfare though that do need it
there 're people with disabilities
or um people eh getting out of prison who are uh trying to start their life over
um the- there are reasons for it
um but it needs to be controlled
i 'm n- i 'm not sure what the best way to do that is though
um
maybe they need to uh
more
the- they need to have some kind of a system to check up on people
maybe th- the rules need to be more strict like the children thing
you should n't be able to have a whole bunch of kids just to get more money off a welfare check
right
yeah
there will always be an issue with it
mhm
yeah
i do n't know the uh the recording before said something about the way it 's done in europe
and it it works over there
i do n't know i do n't know why
um yeah
at all the all the european countries they pay extremely high taxes like seventy-five percent tax rates
you do n't you h- you h- you do n't even get any of your money really
but everything 's provided for you
i mean you do n't have to pay for insurance eh on anything
it 's all there
so i mean i- it works kind of both ways
i- in one sense you do n't y- you 're putting all that money up up front
but it provides for you
and it provides for everybody else
so then when you 're ah when you get to old age and stuff you do n't have to worry about your health care you know and stuff like that
um and i 'm sure it works better for some people than others too
but
what was that
oh
okay
right
right
exactly
yeah
that money could be put to better use
yeah
i did n't even know about that
i did n't did n't hear about that
oh okay
mhm
yeah
oh
that 's the gov- that 's everything in the government 's like that though
there 's always a waste of money um every- everywhere
it 's terrible
but
so
yeah
i see a lot of people that um definitely take advantage of the money that they 're given
and i 've i i know that a lot of times people will they 'll have more children just so that they can get a bigger welfare check
and
yeah
that 's not definitely not how it should work
and then there 's no one n- nothing that regulates it that says you know if you have two kids then we 'll give you the x. amount of dollars for that much you know for for what you need
but you know if you have ten more kids it does n't mean that you can now have that many children and and st- and not support them
right
but then d- in in that type of um
i think a lot of type o- the types of areas that people like that live in they 're not really too concerned about birth control p- and things like that
so they 'll just do whatever they have to do to get more money
now on the other end i think that there are many people that do deserve it for u certain reasons
but i think that it should be on a much shorter time frame
where eh like say with people that collect unemployment they can only do it for a certain amount of time
and then it 's cut
and if you do n't get a job in that time too bad
right
mhm
right
you should n't just depend on it the whole time
right
yeah
i think it 's
right
no
definitely not
but i st- i also think that no matter what new rules they put on it and different m- all the different things that they could possibly do there 's there will still be some type of issue
so
i mean th- the system is already in place
unless they completely knock everything out and start from the beginning which will never happen then i- there 's always going to be some c- some problem that someone has with it
mhm
i guess because they u- tended i- i do n't know how long
i 'm assuming m- a very long time
but that i- it has always been th- like that 's that 's how e- everyone lives
so they do n't
right
mhm
right
mhm
right
yeah
n and even
well even just today they just passed that that new law on the medicare and with the prescription drugs and everything
and
um that
that uh prescription drugs are now g- or a or at least generics are included under medicare plans
that there 's no extra costs
and u b e i think that e the government should focus more on something like that
someone that 's put their time in in working their whole lives
a- and then all of a sudden you know they 're they 're elderly
they they 're you know the- they need th- medical help
and they n- they need prescriptions
and then they ca n't get it because money is going to buy somebody d- you know new sneakers
but and when they 're not even working
yeah
so
yeah
it ju- just came out a little while ago
they just announced it
so
yeah
they could definitely be putting their money into better better areas
mhm
yep
yeah
that 's true
i if if you 're going to m- have extra calories i guess i 'd rather have it in uh some kind of dessert or something
um no
not a whole lot
we ha- i 'm uh we got a family of five here
so it gets a little e- expensive for all five of us to go out and eat like that
so most of our meals we cook at home
and i like to cook too
so i do most of the cooking at home
yeah
you appreciate that more once you get into college and away from it
you know first f- few weeks anyway it- it 's kind of fun to go out to different fast food places and try all the different things
but i- after a couple weeks you kind of miss mom 's home cooking
that 's right
it does get expensive
that 's s- that 's for sure
then it 's nice when mom packs up the leftovers and sends them back with you too
that 's always good
so you 're living in a dorm then where you do n't h- have access to f- cooking stuff
or
yeah
yeah
just try that once and see all the noses that are sticking in there to see what you 're cooking seeing if they can get a taste of it
i did that w- once when i was in college
and that 's it
ta- just have a have a little bit
and then bu- soo- pretty soon you got to make two bags
otherwise you wo n't get any
so what kind of what kind of foods are your favorites
yeah
cheese is one of my favorites too
yeah
it 's hard to find uh w- where i am from it 's hard to find a variety of restaurants or places to go out and eat that kind of stuff around here
we 're very limited
it 's mostly family type restaurants here
so we do n't get a chance
i guess there are a couple chinese places
but i think they 're owned by the same family
so it 's uh pretty much the same menu at every thi- every restaurant
but i 'm i 'm pretty much meat and potatoes myself
i like you know beef and chicken
and i tried something interesting today
for the first time i tried buffalo
that was it was n't bad
it tasted like a little drier
you know beef
yeah
yeah
that 's what i thought too
i mean it 's certainly not worth paying the extra money for unless you 're on you know some kind of diet where you could n't get all the fat that you could from from uh from beef
but i do n't know it was d- different
and now i can say i tried it
so
oh
but those are those are so delicious
um d- deep fried turkey does n't it would n't be the place where i would take those extra calories i guess
yeah
u-
so uh to go along with the topic do you eat out often
or
mm
well i 'm actually a college student
so i do n't really have that option of cooking s- so much
um but i do love going home and eating a meal with my family now and then
yeah
and w- what 's lu- i- i- it also gets pretty expensive
which you never realize when you eat at home whenever you feel like it
so i 've i 've come to appreciate that in a whole new way
which i guess is a good thing
mhm
yeah
we have microwaves
um and actually we have w- w- one stove for our whole building
um which is n't really m- much of a cooking facility
um so preparation of your own food is n't m- much of an option
i mean if you were really determined you could do it
but it 's not easy or common
exactly
i mean e- e- when i even make popcorn in the microwave you get people coming by just to m- have a bite
yeah
hm um that 's a hard question
um eh i mean it ranges
um i love dairy products uh cheese milk ice cream m- yogurt even
um m- love all that stuff
um i uh i do my best to have as much of that as i can
i love all of it
um i 'm trying to think
i l- in terms of like ethnic food i like i do n't know i like chinese
i like japanese
i like uh greek uh italian
i uh i could eat any of it
i love it all
hm
mm
well
b- beef
i actually just tried buffalo about a week ago
i had a buffalo burger
and i was n't e- i do n't know i s- somehow thought it 'd be more different
but it e- it 's just like a dry hamburger
hm
i 've never tried venison which i want to try
mhm
mhm
right
not even when it 's like furs and stuff like that
just testing in general
mhm
right
mhm
what was one of the other topics
i know
um
mhm
right
i mean i guess sometimes it could be advantageous as far as
i mean if it 's not harmful
i mean they got to test it one way or another
right
mhm
right
oh
i agree
i think one of them was uh p- does being a pet owner um influence your buying decisions
was that one of them
i
yeah
i own a dog
but i do n't know how much an influence that has on buying stuff
d- do you own pets
right
i know
mhm
yeah
i guess i 'm not too aware of things that they test dogs and cats on
i mean i think when you think of testings i always think of like lab rats and stuff like that
i mean i guess it really does n't make a difference what kind of an animal that they 're testing with
but
still
mhm
um
i guess it would kind of depend on how legitimate or how um beneficial the tests would be
um i mean if it 's if it is a legitimate cure for aids then i think it is
right
i mean i- it 's you know it 's kind of a double edged sword
it 's like you could have a cure for this horrible disease
or
you know it 's are you going to subject someone else to that
um i 'm actually not really that conscious because well i do n't know men do n't really buy too many products that are tested on animals because most of the products are geared towards women like you know beauty products and stuff
but
um
it does n't really cross my mind
i can say it probably used to maybe five years ago
but it it 's not something that i 'd honestly consider unless i hear something on the news like about a certain company that 's you know using animals in a way that 's cruel
but usually i do n't really i do n't really consider it
um so i 'm not really thinking about furs
that did n't really cross my mind
i 'm thinking more like
um
like testing like facial creams
because a lot of like i let me think
there 's this company called origins
they on on their um products it says you know no animal testing
so i 'm thinking more like products like that
but you 're right
i mean i 'm not a fan of furs
i would n't wear furs anyway
but
but if if there was a product that i was interested in and i knew that they used a certain type of animal testing i would n't i would n't support it
i would n't buy it
so i
yeah
i guess i would consider it
but it depends on what i 'm purchasing
i do n't know
she said it so fast
the only thing i can think of is like drugs because they use they test some drugs on like you know rats
or um
i 'm thinking rats
that 's mostly what they use
um and
i would say if i knew that a certain drug was tested on a animal i probably would n't purchase that drug
i mean because i um i should n't only think of certain products because i mean they use animals to test all kinds of products
consider-
but considering that they use um animals to test certain like cancer drugs
and the side effects are just not you know not al- i mean not great for the animals but you know great for the humans
but that 's something else to consider
but most people would say that because it 's research that would help humans that it 's worth it
but considering if i was that rat i would n't not you know i would n't want to be put through something like that
i 'm not sure
but that 's a good question
do you own any pets
mhm
no
no
i do n't have any pets
i ha- i have had in the past but not right now
this is kind of a hard topic because i never really think about that
it 's not something that really crosses my mind
i mean it 's not recently
i mean i remember the whole thing about furs
and
and um
and all the controversy in the news and stuff
but that was like it 's not it 's not that prevalent anymore
it seems to kind of have died down
mhm
mhm
mhm
well what if what if what if they were testing a d- a drug to cure aids
but the tests that they were using
say they were using monkeys but that that the drug was causing monkeys to g- you know to not torture them
but you know just the side effects were really bad
would you consider that worthwhile
i mean tha- that would be considered cruelty to animals because
i mean
oh
e-
what if the the drug would save millions of lives
do you think that 's something that would be justified
but they wo n't find out unless they test
that 's the problem
yeah
or at um virgin records in new york city
no
i 'm in connecticut
but i go
uh-huh
are you there
yeah
i can hear you
uh-huh
oh
okay
mhm
um on the internet
um advertisement
basically
that 's about yeah
yes
i do
radio also
yeah
mhm
yeah
you do
mhm you hear new stuff
but sometimes it 's they play too much of the same stuff
and then they remix it
and i 'm like oh i hate that
so i just turn to different station
i c- i c-
i like i like older music
i like rap also but not too much
my my whole thing is soul
like i would n't
yeah
i like
oh yeah

so

i- i like all music
it 's just that i wo n't buy a whole britney spears album
i wo n't buy a a whole rock album
th- maybe there 'd be certain songs that hit number one
and then they have them on different c. d.s
then i would get it like a single
but to buy a whole c. d. of rock
um i do n't think so
no
i do n't
i do n't know how to do that
no
i do n't know how to do that

mhm
mhm
yeah

i 'm in new york
i i jus- w-
yes
yeah
can you hear me
um yeah
no
i was just asking because like the first two people i 've done this twice
and the first two people were from new york
so i did n't know if everyone was uh from new york
but
yes
i i buy i buy stuff at like anywhere like virgin or like e- smaller stores too
where do you find out about new music
yeah
yeah
that 's kind of interesting
do you listen to radio
uh-huh
so like you hear new stuff on the radio that you want to hear
but did you
yeah
uh-huh
do you like older music then
yeah
soul music
do you like older soul music
sure
do you play music
yeah
me too
that 's good
i uh
yeah
i used to play uh piano as well and a little guitar
so
oh really
did you go to college for music
oh
okay
uh-huh
are you still doing it now
so you 're still doing music now
oh
wow
uh-huh
and uh that 's cool
and uh do you take classes for composing
or just for
do you take classes for singing
so you 're not taking classes for music right now
oh
okay
that 's cool
yeah
um uh what uh eh y- so you do n't like britney spears
nah
uh-huh
yeah
huh
what kind of uh uh what kind of music do you dislike
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
do you uh download music
i- uh why do n't you
oh really
i was wondering if it was a moral thing
oh okay
so you just you buy everything
yeah
ah oh uh well um i 'm sorry
it 's kind of noisy
i 'm just walking around on my work break
how many times have you called in on this
once
yeah
uh-oh
oh you have to finish the ten minutes i think
right
yeah
well that 's cool
yeah
this is my last one
i actually forgot about it for like a month
and then i remembered oh i better do that so i can get my check
um i do n't know do you have any questions
how has it touched me
um i think um i used to actually s- i still do like write songs myself a little bit
so it 's kind of uh really important to me i guess and has touched me by making me want to be involved in it i guess
and uh i think it 's uh like many people say
i think it like uh kind of stirs my memories a lot of like music i l- used to listen to when i was a kid
or like it 's kind of a tool for me or i- in that way where i like to listen to music that i used to listen to a long time ago
and i do n't know it just makes me feel emotional i guess good music
that 's a good question though
how how has it touched you
yeah
i 'm a member of that
i 'm doing that
uh also there 's another one beside that sound and spirit
have you heard of them
yeah
they 're close to the b. m. g. people
and so i joined both clubs
and i ordered this stereo in the mail
when the stereo got here it w- eh d- we had a bunch of cracking noises on it
so i had to send it back
now i 'm stuck with all these c. d.s
i do n't know what to do
i think i 'm going to get one of those that you hook on your hip and ride around on the freeways and stuff like that listening to music during the day
yeah
a portable c. d. player
how much did you spend on yours
does it play good for forty-seven dollars
weightless
how 's the sound quality on those
mhm
i see
uh the internet i do n't think y- it can be exhausted
do you know anything about the computers in england um registering data how much information they were able to put on there
well i 'm pretty sure it was everything that 's ever been recorded on the earth
and this was done in the the sixties or seventies when computers first came out
and the size disk that all the information is on is about the size of a silver dollar
huh and so what we 're experiencing just s- every time you buy a tape or something e- how much you can put maybe two three screenplays on a disk that you have in your computer
and um
but m- even though that 's down rated you got to look at how much the computers cost whenever they first were made before they came out to the public
do you remember the prices on that
no
it was something like uh seven hundred thousand dollars for a computer
and um so you see how they were able to put everything on the earth that was ever r- recorded in a small cube and then reduce the price but also reduce the amount of information you can get
whenever i was thinking a computer would come out i was thinking you only need one disk
and you could access or store anything you know for the rest of your life
i did n't know you it was going to be stuck with a c- a whole catalog of disk and still only get limited information
mhm
yeah
that is a lot of money de- discuss and effort and time um what 's already there
yes
it 's a lot to think about
mhm
no
yeah
maybe you can get you a new player
oh
a portable c. d. player
i just bought one of those too actually
mine
eh it was about forty-seven dollars and something
um
yeah
it plays real good
it 's got stereo sound and a headset
and it 's by philips
it 's um c- it 's a new s- style they 're coming out with
there 's different companies trying to make a slim compact where they 're getting real thin compared to how thick they used to be
yeah
they 're trying to make them lighter and more slender
so i got that style
but you can get e- get them like at a store like wal-mart or something really cheap
they go w- under that actually
you can get one for like thirty some dollars even
uh it 's good
i had one of those too
and it was totally fine
they come in brand names
you can choose from uh philips or sony or basically whatever you want
um no
uh oh
right
no
but i think they were quite more expensive probably like a thousand five hundred a piece
wow
mhm
well they 're talking about they 're doing something with the laws uh copyright and stuff as far as the um uh kind of music that you can download
they want to like charge uh fees for it every time you were to download a- like a song
i think that is like a little bit outrageous
what do you think
from everywhere i knew
um you know we 'd want to get out in the sun because i thought it looked better with a tan
but actually having a tan is damaged skin
i mean so you 're not helping at all
in fact
yeah
so you know it 's like um
it 's really it 's really um
right
yeah
right
well i do n't i do n't i do n't know if there 's um
e- you know i mean i 've seen people from india that that um you know i taught tennis with that were much darker than most of the blacks in the part of mississippi i grew up in
and um then i found out that 's t- um dark skinned blacks are treated worse by light skinned blacks which was shocking to me
really
okay
well i know i know in africa you know you 've got like um
uh uh certain uh tribes uh are really tall
and others are um extrem- incredibly short you know the the average height
you know um and of course for an average to be an average you got to have some
really t- like the maasai uh the average height is seven feet tall
and and so that means they got a bunch of people over seven feet eh you know um to to have that average be that high
so um i just wondered uh you know how um uh you know like uh asian people tend to be much shorter
uh and ta- and and like um certain parts in africa th- you know the average height 's seven feet tall
which which kind of i- i- is is a just as big a difference in color of skin
you know i mean um there- there 's all kinds of um variations of you know height and and and colors of skin and and um uh of course the the asian um thing with the eyes being um slanted
i- i just you know um
d- eh mm d- uh why would s- how how would somebody 's eyes get slanted
you know i mean ho- where wou- you know where would that come fr- and how did that happen
you know uh i mean i can understand pigmentation of skin
but you know
yeah
yeah
they bound their feet
yeah
and and it 's like i mean like like who who decided oh you know what we need to start bounding people 's feet
you know uh we need to bound women 's feet
um you know who- who- i mean y- was it a k- you know you know like the reason men have to wear neckties to be dressed up is because uh some uh king w- w- forgot to take his bib off after a feast
and so the people at the table you know like the king 's court you know i mean you 've got like probably fifty or a hundred people you know at the king 's table
you know and they 're eating this huge meal
right
and so no one dared take their um napkin off their collar
otherwise the king woul- would look foolish if everybody else you know had taken their napkin off
and his was still on
he had forgotten it was on
and so r- to in order to to not make the king look foolish everyone left their napkin on their neck
and and it became a fashion thing
and so now you know or for hundreds of years now men have had to wear ties because some m- monarch made a mistake
and and uh you know just i mean stuff like tha- i mean history 's full of just w- weird uh quirks
yeah
right
right
right
well
yeah
it 's uh it 's it 's like um
well from a standpoint of of you know like um
my uh obviously my b- my brother 's and his wife uh adopted baby is going to be growing up at some point and realize that hey you know i have straight black hair
and nobody else in this family has straight black hair
you know
mhm
yeah
yeah
i got i got sun poisons
so i i know
so
we 're all one race
it 's just they were born closer to the equator than we were
that 's what started the black thing
they were born white
and then they end up getting darker and darker and darker
and their kids came out dark because they were dark
you know
so
than
yep
it 's uh
there 's dark skinned mexicans and and white there 's white mexicans and black mexicans too
yes
the light skinned mexicans they look white
and you ca n't tell they 're mexicans until they talk
and there 's darker mexicans that look like mexican
so there 're white and black mexicans
so o-
yeah
whew
yep
mm
yeah
i do n't know
yeah
and they got
and you see um chinese and japanese w- women have smaller feet because they tie their shoes and their feet or something like that
and they make really tiny feet
yeah
yeah
yeah
mhm
mhm
yep
mhm
stuff
yeah
only thing i do n't like no- right now in this day and time is because of nine eleven all the mixed children and all the oriental children are being treated different because they think they 're from over there with what happened on nine eleven
and they 're all being treated totally different
and i do n't like that
i do n't like m- plus my son he c- he comes up to me
he 's like mommy what color am i because because he 's not like his daddy
and he 's not like his mommy
he 's like what am i
i 'm like i ca- tell him biracial
and he 's like i do n't understand that
i 'm like well you 're a little bit of mommy
and you 're a little bit of daddy
he 's like w- why
you know he has this this conversation that you ca n't answer
yep
